many cases , we may grow so accustomed to our patterns , no matter how toxic they may be , that we eventually accept them as normal .\nToxic thought patterns are much like that .\nBeginning in our early adolescence , and perhaps even childhood , we begin to develop patterns of thinking , and coping strategies to move through life .\nHowever , just because we have been doing something for as long as we could remember doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from those behaviors .\nThe following are 10 toxic thought patterns that can destroy your life , and I am not exaggerating .\nAdditionally , I \u2019 ve included a few expert tips to help you to find freedom from them .\nBlack or white , or all or nothing thinking patterns happen when we can not see any middle ground .\nWe are either all in or all out .\nWe may view others as perfect one day , and then when they disappoint us , we instantly swap to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of thinking is not only toxic in relationships but can also make it difficult to manage our lives .\nA mental filter happens when we begin to pick negative details from our life , and then get caught up in an obsession with them .\nIn turn , while our lives are going pretty well , we may get caught up in the negative , losing sight of the good things surrounding us .\nOvergeneralizing happens to us when something negative happens , and we view it as something that will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have a string of bad luck , and then you say \u201c Why is this happening to me ?\nMy life is over .\nMy life is trash.\n\u201d In reality , bad things have happened , yes .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean they will continue to happen , and it doesn \u2019 t mean every good thing that has ever happened is now no longer valid .\nOftentimes , our brains can trick us by picking up on a few cues , and then piecing a picture together incorrectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what someone is saying to us , and automatically assume the worst .\nDifferent components of this are when we incorrectly read someone \u2019 s face and assume they hate us or mean us ill will .\nOr , when we begin to anticipate that bad things will happen , without much basis .\nIn some cases , no matter how many good things happen , some of us tend to believe that those good things don \u2019 t matter .\nThis helps them to continue to stand by negative beliefs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place when an individual assumes that people ( most people ) simply can not be trusted .\nThey are easily angered by others and take small things very personally .\nOftentimes , they isolate themselves from others they perceive as hateful to them .\nIn many cases , these are unfounded assumptions based on their negative thought patterns .\nMost people with extreme anxiety can likely relate to this one .\nCatastrophizing happens when overthinking takes hold in a situation that makes us anxious , and in our minds , we create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the situation .\nHowever , the narrative is the absolute worst possible case outcome .\nFor example , you may be in a relationship , and when your partner doesn \u2019 t answer your phone call , you begin to think about things , and assume they have decided they no longer want to be with you .\nIn fact , you believe that likely they have already replaced you and are just trying to figure out how to tell you .\nWhen they do call you back a few hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text them \u201c It \u2019 s over.\n\u201d That \u2019 s just an example , but many others could happen in the workspace , in friendships , and other elements of our life .\nOftentimes , people who catastrophize end up making their fears play out .\nSetting high expectations and then berating yourself for not living by them can be very toxic .\nThe reason being is that when you motivate yourself by \u2018 should \u2019 and then beat yourself up later with \u2018 should \u2019 you are left feeling guilty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only leads to resentment .\nPersonalization happens when we take the blame for external events .\nWe may believe that we are the cause of everything that goes wrong around us when our thought patterns lead towards personalization .\nLabeling , regardless of whether it \u2019 s a label placed on ourselves or others , will never do anything beneficial for us .\nFor example , you may take a nap and forget to take out the trash , so you say , \u201c I \u2019 m lazy.\n\u201d After you say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is time to take out the trash , you just shrug your shoulders , \u201c Guess I \u2019 m just lazy.\n\u201d And then you lay down for another nap .\nAfter a while , when we use self-deprecating labels enough , we begin to believe them .\nSo how do you handle and change these thought patterns ?\n1 .\nRecognize them & draw awareness to them .\nNow that you know what these negative thought patterns are , when you notice yourself beginning a spiral , pause .\nWhat has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nRemember that while these patterns are normal to you , they are generally toxic , and it \u2019 s likely that these thought patterns are holding you back .\nRationalize with yourself for a moment .\nDraw awareness to your present moment .\nGet out of your head .\nA great way to do this is to point out three things you can see , touch , hear or smell .\nIt doesn \u2019 t matter what the combination is , just bring your senses out of your mind .\nBreathe .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAsk yourself , \u201c What am I doing at this moment ?\n\u201d Do this every time you get sucked up into a pattern of overthinking .\nOnce you are in awareness and mindfulness , question your thought patterns .\nAsk yourself what benefit these thoughts are , and ask yourself about the logic and rationality is behind them .\nNow that you have questioned your thought patterns , re-direct them .\nFor example , let \u2019 s say you are anxious , and you \u2019 ve just begun a new job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you begin to catastrophize .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to get fired .\nNo one is going to like me .\nI should just quit.\n\u201d Stop , breathe , and draw awareness to the moment .\nIn reality , nothing major has happened .\nNo one has given you a reason to think they don \u2019 t like you .\nYou haven \u2019 t done anything wrong to get fired .\nYou begin to consider all of these things , and you redirect your thoughts , \u201c I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me .\nI \u2019 m okay .\nIt \u2019 s okay to be anxious .\nI just need to work hard and be friendly .\nThis is a great opportunity .\nI will make sure it turns out well .\n\u201d", "author":

.\nClairsentient people can pick up on people , places , and things , within moments of coming into contact with them .\nOftentimes , they may realize someone \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person never voices them .\n2 .\nYou feel drawn to the supernatural and the occult .\nClairsentient people are often naturally drawn to the spiritual realm .\nAt an early age , they often report liking crystals , tarot cards , and mystical beings .\nAnd their interest-only increases over time .\n3 .\nPeople seem drawn to you to tell you about their personal lives .\nA major indicator that you are clairsentient is when you notice people that you don \u2019 t even know feel the need to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal things about them .\nThe reason for this is that they sense your abilities and naturally feel at ease with you .\nIn a way , this works as a means to heal them .\n4 .\nYou feel overstimulated when you are in a crowd .\nClairsentient people are very sensitive .\nDue to this , they can pick up on the thoughts , feelings , and emotions of others .\nUnfortunately , when you have these abilities and are surrounded by a dozen or more people , it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overstimulated .\nPeople who believe themselves to be empathic are often also clairsentient .\nBeing an empath is associated with clairsentience , but not all empaths are clairsentient .\nWith that being said , everyone who is clairsentient is an empath .\nAs someone who is clairsentient , I remember seeing ghosts as a child .\nI could feel them and sense them , but I tried to tell myself as I got older that I must have just had a wild imagination .\nIn my early 20 \u2019 s this started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day .\nIt just comes with the territory .\n7 .\nYou feel the energy in rooms upon entering .\nUpon entering a room , if you can sense the feelings and emotions and overall vibe , you are likely an empath .\nA good example of this is when you enter into a room and suddenly feel terror and sadness , only to find out someone died in that room years before .\nClairsentients can pick up on things like that , without even meaning to .\n8 .\nYou get strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever met someone , and just had a really bad feeling about them , only to find out later on you were right ?\nThat is another sign of clairsentience .\nAnd the more often this happens to you , the more likely you are to be clairsentient .\n9 .\nSometimes you know exactly what someone is about to say before they do .\nIf you find that you can often finish people \u2019 s sentences , or even guess what someone is about to say before they ever open their mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason this is so is that when you can pick up on people \u2019 s energy , you can usually pick up on their thoughts and feelings too .\nClairsentient individuals are easily overstimulated , which makes it hard for them to be around in highly-stimulating environments for too long .\nIf loud noises overwhelm you , or bright lights , and you find that public places make you feel queazy , you are probably clairsentient .\nClairsentient individuals are very aware of their environments , and also of other people and themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to see or

an extension of themselves , which only come in handy when they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends , so too does their \u2018 love \u2019 for them .\nNarcissists view themselves as much more than they are .\nThey believe themselves to know it all , and they believe they are always right .\nDuring relationships , there have to be two people who can place their egos aside for the greater good of the couple .\nSince this isn \u2019 t possible in a relationship with a narcissist , the relationships inevitably fail .\n3 .\nThey love themselves before anyone else .\nBeing in a relationship involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of your partner sometimes , and narcissists just can not do that .\nThey only consider what is good for themselves , and when the going gets tough , the narcissist gets going .\nOne of the criteria for being diagnosed with narcissism is to lack of empathy .\nNarcissists can not and will not consider the feelings and needs of others , so it doesn \u2019 t bother them to discard people when they no longer have a use for them .\n5 .\nThey have a never-ending need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of praise .\nThey want admiration and to be placed on a pedestal .\nUnfortunately , love doesn \u2019 t work that way .\nAs time goes on , the spark fizzles and normal life takes hold , when that happens there is work to be done to keep the relationship afloat .\nNarcissists don \u2019 t want to wait it out , they want to always be the center of attention .\nSo when their constant supply simmers a bit , they don \u2019 t stay much longer .\n6 .\nTheir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold others to an

which you experience failure .\nWhen failure arises in life , the mistakes that led us there should serve as learning experiences .\nHowever , when you continue to make the same mistakes over and over again , you are doomed to repeat the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience the same failure .\n2 .\nBelieving that there are no good ones left .\nEverything we accomplish in life starts in our minds .\nBut , when you start with a pessimistic attitude and believe that \u201c There are no good women left , \u201d or \u201c There are no good men left , \u201d you prevent your progress .\nAdditionally , you may end up blocking yourself from even trying and when you do try , you may settle time and time again for the wrong ones .\nNo one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s great to have standards , but when your standards are unreachable , you are going to end up single .\nPart of finding love is learning to be accepting of the flaws of others because we are all flawed .\nI am not saying to settle for someone terrible , but if you find a good person and they have a few minor flaws , and you shut them out for not reaching your standards , you are setting yourself up for failure .\nAnother recipe for disaster is trying to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of people do this because they sense a good connection and out of fear of losing it , or fear of being alone , they want to seal the deal .\nUnfortunately , one of two things results from this : you end up in a bad relationship without giving yourself the chance to figure that out , or you push the other person away because they aren \u2019 t ready to speed things up .\nSome people have the mindset that they will just wait for the right person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t find love .\nWhile it is true that people can come into your life without you trying , it \u2019 s much better to set your intentions towards finding love and at the very least pushing yourself to network and go on dates .\n6 .\nBeing overly critical of yourself .\nWhen you are overly critical of yourself with someone new , they are likely going to pick up on your self-criticism , and they are likely to believe you .\nWhy wouldn \u2019 t they ?\nYou are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they will take you at your word .\nOn the other hand , you may end up emanating the wrong vibes , which also isn \u2019 t very attractive .\nConfidence is sexy .\nNot arrogance , but there is most definitely something to be said of confidence .\nIt may be tempting to settle into the first connection that seems comfortable , but be wary of attaching yourself to emotionally unavailable people .\nYou may assume that with time , they will open up to real love with you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person isn \u2019 t going to suddenly open up because you waited on them .\nIn some cases , we are the toxic date .\nEveryone has toxic traits , and if you aren \u2019 t self-aware , you may not even realize the vibes you are giving off .\nGoing on a date and complaining about everything and everyone in your life is not a good look .\nTalking badly about your ex with a new possible love interest isn \u2019 t the best play .\nAnd acting rude or disinterested as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t going to get you another date .\nAn almost relationship is a situation in which you have a good connection with someone , and it feels like it \u2019 s heading towards commitment , but never does .\nThis may happen when you start talking to someone , being intimate with them and dating them , but they express disinterest in commitment at that time .\nSo , you wait and give them time , but they never change their outlook .\nSuddenly , you are doing boyfriend/girlfriend things without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In turn , you are wasting your time .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

read what people are thinking .\nHowever , body language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone \u2019 s mind .\nYou can also read their eyes .\nAnd while people can change their body language , they can not change their eyes , which will often give them away .\nSo where do you begin ?\nThe best place to begin is the pupils .\nAccording to research , pupils dilate and narrow , depending on a few factors .\nFor example , when we are excited and interested in something , our pupils increase .\nIn one study , male and female participants were made to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn females , their pupil size increased when they viewed men , and in men , their pupils increased when looking at women .\nThe same type of study has also been carried out on males who identified as homosexual , and the results

when someone is lying , you can also read their eyes much like body language .\nNeuro-linguistic Programming ( NLP ) allows experts to observe eye cues to understand their frame of mind .\nTo do this , expert Vanessa Van Edwards explains you have to \u201c find their baseline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are under normal , non-threatening conditions.\n\u201d This is exactly what body language experts

in 1997 , they used the questions to observe how closeness forms between two people and to understand how love affects the brain .\nTo carry out the study , they had participants ask each other the

adults , and I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of alone time to remain sane , and you don \u2019 t get that with kids .\nIf I \u2019 d had them , I might have become one of those horrid humans who feed their kids Benadryl to make them sleep , just for some peace and quiet .\nChildless is better for me .\n5 .\nHispanic Guy here , close to sixty years old , no I don \u2019 t , the fact that I chose to stay child free is very unusual in my culture , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free I just avoided it having children because I knew I was not really ready , it just progress from there , still , now I know that most

most of us we assume that time is absolute , however , science has shown that is not the case .\nFor example , Einstein had many theories , one of which is known as the theory of relativity .\nAccording to this theory , time is a relative concept .\nIn recent times , researchers have tested this theory and observed something quite interesting .\nTo do this , physicists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different heights .\nWhat they found was that height has a major impact on how time works .\nFor example , even a height difference of around 1 foot was able to cause a measurable difference in how time passed .\nAccording to Live Science , \u201c if one twin spent 79 years living at an altitude 1 foot higher than her sister , the first twin would end up approximately 90 billionths of a second older , the researchers found.\n\u201d They were able to measure how time passed by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a single charged aluminum atom that vibrated between two energy levels over a million billion times per second .\nThen , one clock was placed on a lower elevation and another on a higher elevation .\nWhat they found was that the clock on a higher elevation ran faster than the lower clock .\nThis is exactly as Einstein theorized , and is known as \u201c time-dilation , \u201d which asserts that time is intrinsically tied to gravity .\nBecause Earth has a gravitational field , it can warp space-time around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the distance an object was from Earth .\nOne of the lead authors , James Chin-Wen Chou of the National Institute of Standards and Technology , says , \u201c We have to discard the concept of absolute time.\n\u201d In the book \u201c The Order of Time , \u201d Author Italian theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli suggests that our sense of time is forever flowing forward , and could be a highly subjective projection .\nAfterall , when looking at reality on the smallest of scares , time vanishes .\n\u201c If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d writes Rovelli , \u201c then the difference between past and future vanishes \u2026 in the elementary grammar of things , there is no distinction between \u2019 cause \u2019 and \u2018 effect.\n\u2019 \u201d So why do we always perceive time as flowing forward ?\nRovelli notes that , although time disappears on the small scales , we obviously still perceive events occurring in sequential order in reality .\nOr , in other words , order changing into disorder ; an egg cracking and getting fried .\nThe key aspects are described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that heat always passes from hot to cold .\nA one way street .\nFor example , an ice cube melts in a cup of tea , never in reverse .\n\u201c Entropy growth orients time and permits the existence of traces of the past , and these permit the possibility of memories , which hold together our sense of identity .\nI suspect that what we call the \u201c flowing \u201d of time has to be understood by studying the structure of our brain rather than by studying physics : evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feeds off memory in order to anticipate the future .\nThis is what we are listening to when we listen to the passing of time .\nUnderstanding the \u201c flowing \u201d of time is therefore something that may pertain to neuroscience more than to fundamental physics .\nSearching for the explanation of the feeling of flow in physics might be a mistake.\n\u201d Science still has a lot to learn about how we perceive time , and the way time operates differently depending on the scale .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

spark .\nOver time , as you get to know one another , and get comfortable , the spark will begin to dwindle at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , it is important to keep reigniting that spark .\nNot only will it make your relationship happier and more healthy , but it will also make you both very happy on an individual level .\nWith that being said , how do you keep a relationship alive ?\nHere are 14 ways .\n1 .\nNever stop being curious about your partner .\nAfter a while , you may assume you know everything about your partner .\nHowever , people are not stagnant and unchanging creatures .\nOn the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and circumstances will change each day , much like your own .\nWhen you are around your partner , give them your full attention .\nDon \u2019 t talk to them while playing on your phone , place the phone down , and give them your undivided attention .\nListen to them actively , and have meaningful conversations with them regularly .\nMake it a point to communicate with your partner .\nEven if you only have a small amount of time together each day , make the most of it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s flaws & more on supporting them and complimenting what is good about them .\nRather than focusing on your partner \u2019 s flaws and trying to change them , embrace them for who they are , and encourage them to grow into the best version of themselves .\nWhen you focus on their positive attributes and encourage them to grow , you will be met with less resistance , and it will help you to bond with your partner .\nA research study had couples broken up into two sets : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that focused on pleasant activities .\nThose who went on an exciting adventure ended up having higher relationship satisfaction overall when compared to those who did a pleasant activity .\nEach of us loves differently , and it \u2019 s important to meet your partner where they are at .\nFor example , some people love by nurturing and performing acts of kindness for their partner .\nOthers show love by talking things out and being attentive .\nAnd some people are more withdrawn , but passionate when they speak up .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTake time to check on your partner on an emotional level .\nFrom time to time , ask them how they feel , if anything is bothering them , how things could be better , and what you can do to support them .\nNot only will it help you to maintain an understanding of their headspace , but it will also show them that you care and want to do whatever it takes to keep the relationship afloat .\nEach week , plan a date night .\nEven if that date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering a pizza and watching a movie , it sets a routine for the two of you to touch down and unwind as a team .\nWhile it may not sound sexy , it \u2019 s important to be on the same page as your partner when it comes to financing .\nFinancial troubles are one of the leading causes of divorce , so ensuring that you are both transparent and on the same page helps to keep things moving in a good direction .\nPhysical intimacy is important .\nIt may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it \u2019 s extremely important .\nEven if you just take a moment to look each other in the eyes and kiss , you are maintaining the intimacy and passion that was present in the relationship when it began .\nWhen your partner is vulnerable with you , be respectful .\nDon \u2019 t use their vulnerabilities later on to shame them , and don \u2019 t share them with anyone else outside of the relationship .\nYou are their safe place , and they are yours \u2013 don \u2019 t @ @ @ @

mean you should be disrespectful towards their beliefs .\nPerhaps one of the most important tips is to be adaptable .\nRelationships consist of two people , and people change , grow , and evolve .\nSo do our situations .\nWe have to be able to grow and change and adapt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day to keep a relationship alive .\nIt \u2019 s work , but it \u2019 s worth it !\nDon \u2019 t ever stop

create a treatment for the disease using ultrasound technology that would help to rid the brain of neurotoxic amyloid plaques that cause memory decline in Alzheimer \u2019 s patients .\nAccording to Science Alert , Alzheimer \u2019 s disease is the result of the build-up of two types of lesions : amyloid plaques , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up getting stuck between neurons , which causes clusters of beta-amyloid molecules to clump together .\nSimilar to this , neurofibrillary tangles can be found in the neurons in the brain , which also clump up .\nIn turn , microtubules end up twisted , which

their everyday lives .\nWitches work by intentions , and to do this , they take time to clarify their intentions daily .\nFor example , if they are looking for their dream job , they may set their intention as , \u201c I intend to find a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to pursue my writing career.\n\u201d This can also be made more simple .\nOn a daily level , you can refer to tasks or things you need as

manifestation tool that witches use is a positive mindset .\nIf you walk around engaging in negative self-talk , it makes it much harder to get things done .\nWhen you tell yourself and the universe that you can not do something , then you are already blocking yourself .\nWhen negative thoughts come up , push them back , or reframe them .\n3 .\nThey work with the cycles of the moon .\nEach month

astrology signs that are at play during the moon cycles as well for an extra bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentional boosters ( candles , herbs , flowers , colors , etc . )\nWhen witches set an intention , they use correspondences to help set their intentions and manifest them in reality .\nIf you need more money , you would use colors like green or gold .\nPatchouli is a great her for making money , and cayenne is as well .\nThe energies contained in these correspondences help to give an added push towards goal manifestation .\nGratitude is so important .\nWhen you catch yourself feeling negative , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might say , \u201c Today is such a blessing .\nI reached my work goals , the house is clean , and I even had time to enjoy a peaceful meal with my family .\nI am so thankful for this.\n\u201d 6 .\nThey forgive themselves and others for mistakes .\nForgiveness is another manifestation tool that is often overlooked .\nWhen we hold onto guilt from our human error and failures , it blocks our ability to manifest .\nLet go of that guilt and move forward .\nWitches typically live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves , \u201c Harm none and do what thou wilt.\n\u201d This means , live your

about where you fit into natural life .\n10 .\nThey take actionable steps towards their goals .\nManifestation is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , it also involves making steps towards them .\nFor example

way it should , there is less of a gap between actual age and epigenetic age .\nThe larger the gap between these two things , the more likely they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .\nOxytocin is known as the love hormone , but it \u2019 s extremely important for children , because it bonds them to their parents .\nAdditionally , oxytocin helps them to have trust , and is also a regulatory hormone that keeps

also help to make your child happier now .\nHugs are extremely calming , and assure your child that they are loved , and secure .\nFor children , feeling loved and feeling secure as just as much their needs as a healthy meal in their tummy and proper rest .\nStudies show that babies who are hugged more have better brain development .\nAccording to researcher Emily Mudd , We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re born , that touch , physical touch , attention , and hugs , are so very important for both nervous system regulation , and brain development , \u201d and continuing , she explains , \u201c From the

this is why hugs are so extremely important to them .\n7 .\nChildren who are hugged more are smarter .\nWhen children are hugged more , they actually end up smarter .\nPart of the brain development

that respect is something that is engrained in kids , but that simply isn \u2019 t the case .\nRespect is taught , and it takes time and the proper methods to instill respect into children .\nAnd while you may believe you are one and done , it may take years of continued work to get your child on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be frustrating when your child is disrespectful , making it hard to maintain your composure .\nHowever , the last thing you want to do is lose your cool , because that will inevitably cause an even deeper disconnect .\nSo what are the best methods for teaching your

something for them , or please when they want something , is extremely important .\n3 .\nBe respectful , while confronting the disrespect .\nWhen you confront your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely counterproductive to be disrespectful to them while trying to teach them about respect .\nKids often repeat how they are treated , not just what they are taught .\nMake your expectations clear to your child .\nAnd not only do the limitations and expectations need to be clear , but they also need to be realistic for their age and experience .\nYou can not expect a 12-month-old to know to say thank you each time they should .\nIt takes time .\nDon \u2019 t just wait for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect .\nIf you see a moment in which someone is being extremely respectful or disrespectful , say \u201c Look how respectful that young boy is being by saying thank you , isn \u2019 t that good ?\n\u201d Or vice versa .\n6 .\nIdentify what is causing the disrespect .\nThere may be an underlying reason for why your child is suddenly being more disrespectful than usual .\nFor example , if they have been respectful to you for a long time , and meet a new friend , and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t usual for them , it may be time to confront the situation and explain why their behavior is unacceptable .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

Narcissists", "content": "Empaths are highly empathetic people who can feel the emotions of others on a deeper level than others .\nNarcissists are self-absorbed individuals who lack empathy , so it is likely no surprise that the two combined are a disastrous mix .\nWhen the narcissist and the empath enter into a relationship , platonic or otherwise , it \u2019 s a very toxic bond that will go nowhere fast .\nFor the empath , who is a natural-born healer , their first instinct is to love and nurture their friend or partner .\nHowever , because the narcissist knows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking and taking until the empath has finally had enough .\nAlong the way , this toxic bond can leave a lasting mark on the empath , causing them to pick up bad habits and long-lasting emotional scars .\nHere are 8 bad habits empaths pick up from dealing with a narcissist .\n1 .\nThey begin to doubt themselves .\nPart of how narcissists operate is to gaslight their victims .\nPut simply , this is the act of purposefully making someone doubt their perspective of reality .\nDue to this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world can begin doubting themselves .\nHowever , because the empath is so sensitive , the abuse of the narcissist can weigh on them especially .\nAfter a while , the abuse of the narcissist can begin to wear on the empath .\nWhile empaths are natural-born givers , they also need love .\nWhen they continue to give and give and give , but get nothing in return , it can lead them to feel as though they aren \u2019 t even worthy of love .\nNaturally , empaths tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the expense of others .\nThey are natural-born healers , so it \u2019 s just in their nature to do this .\nWhen they confront the narcissist , and the narcissist turns things around on them , they begin to accept the blame and burden , rather than have a conflict with the narcissist .\nAfter a while , they become so accustomed to narcissistic abuse , that it becomes engrained in them to take the blame for everything .\n4 .\nThey lose sight of their boundaries .\nEveryone needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries .\nAnd when other people assert boundaries with the narcissist , they are often run over .\nIn the case of the empath , who merely wants to make the narcissist happy , they may allow the narcissist to run over their boundaries for so long , that they no longer know what their boundaries are .\n5 .\nThey say they are sorry a lot .\nNarcissists are known to make their victims feel guilty , when in reality they aren \u2019 t .\nFor example , the empath might approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harm them .\nRather than accept responsibility for their actions , they turn things around on the empath .\nBecause the empath simply wants to please the narcissist , or because they have a hard time being mean to others , they end up saying sorry a lot .\nEventually , this becomes a pattern , in which they constantly say they are sorry all the time .\nAfter taking abuse for so long , even after they have left , they may have a hard time respecting themselves .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is that the narcissist works to undermine the empath \u2019 s confidence , and the other is that they have a hard time coping with the fact that they accepted the abuse for so long .\nAnother bad habit empaths get from narcissists is that they end up isolating after the abuse .\nBecause the narcissist has damaged them and drained them so badly , they will have a very difficult time trusting in others .\nSelf-care is especially important for an empath .\nUnfortunately , because the narcissist breaks them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up falling to the wayside .\nHowever , it \u2019 s especially essential after narcissistic abuse for them to focus on self-care .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

get vague , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad sign if you want something committed to coming from the relationship .\nWhen someone is flakey on where you stand with them , they will likely stay flakey , and

staying positive became an unhealthy coping mechanism that carried forward into other relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative \u201d emotions \u2014 Feelings of sadness , anger , resentment , loneliness

.\nRespondASAP only works when a parent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that when he told his son about the app , he asked if there would be a function to urgently contact his dad if need be .\nBecause of that , the app was designed to have a two-way system , where the parent and child enter into an agreement that both can send urgent messages provided that neither of them abuses the privilege .\nAnd while the app was created with the intention of it being useful for sending urgent messages to kids , some of Nick \u2019 s friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adults .\nTheir suggestions ranged from changing

another to fit a mold you don \u2019 t already fit .\nThis push/pull dynamic is extremely toxic .\nWhen you are together , it feels uncomfortable or like a chore .\nYou don \u2019 t feel like you can open up with them , and you often have to force small talk to get things going .\nHonestly , it feels like more work than it is actual chemistry .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything .\nBut , when it comes to core values and beliefs , things can get a little trickier .\nFor the short term , you can put differences like these aside .\nHowever , if you are planning on being in a long-term relationship

interests .\nThere again , you don \u2019 t have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has to be some sort of backbone to the relationship in the form of shared interests .\nIf the two of you hate each other \u2019

will likely eventually treat you .\nAnd if they are already showing signs of disrespect to you , this won \u2019 t likely change .\nDisrespect is a deal-breaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerate it , eventually it \u2019 s going to tear the relationship apart .\nSomeone who is hot/cold is someone who may one day be all in , acting as though they are in love , but in the next moment they pull back

be someone else when you are around your partner , you are not in the right relationship .\nThis is a sign that there isn \u2019 t much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a sign that fundamental differences are

and still can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the other person wants , this is a bad sign .\n10 .\nYour friends and family dislike them .\nOur friends and family can often sense things about new people that we can not .\nWhere we are blinded , our friends and family are more hypervigilant .\nAnd while it is true that sometimes , they may be too protective over us , when the vast majority of the people you love don \u2019 t like the person you are with , it \u2019 s time to go .\n11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you .\nRelationships begin with a phase in which we get to know one another .\nSo it can take time to fully get to know someone .\nBut , to do this , we have to have a genuine interest in each other .\nIf your new person doesn \u2019 t even ask about you , or how your day is , or anything like that , likely , they never will get to know you .\n12 .\nYou have fundamental differences when it comes to kids .\nWhile you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away , it \u2019 s good to gauge where each other stands on this topic for the future .\nWhen this question comes up if one of you wants kids and the other does not , this is an indicator that the connection simply isn \u2019 t going to work .\nIf it \u2019 s just the beginning , and this person is already pushing all of your limits , it is going to get old fast .\nIf they leave you hanging on reading for days , say rude remarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , this is

for where you can squeeze in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time to yourself .\n6 .\nWorrying about things beyond their control .\nEveryone worries , but when you allow your worries to control you , they can consume you .\nAnd unfortunately , worrying about things , especially things you can not control , does not make anything change .\nIt \u2019 s simply just a waste of time and a waste of energy you could put on focusing on what is within your control .\nNegative thought patterns happen when we begin negative self-talk .\nFor example , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugh , today is going to be so stressful .\nIt \u2019 s just going to be awful.\n\u201d And from then on out , that \u2019 s all you focus on .\nUnfortunately , these thoughts can become a self-fulfilling prophecy .\nNo one likes a complainer .\nAnd although it may be tempting to get caught up in the moment when you are upset , it \u2019 s better to approach a complaint with \u201c How can I make this better ?\n\u201d Think problem-solving , not negativity .\nPeople who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances end up giving themselves the short end of the stick .\nWhen you take on the role , that is exactly what you become : the victim .\nIf you instead say , I am not a victim , I am a survivor , and continue pushing forward and taking responsibility for your own life , you will accomplish much more .\nHigh-achievers don \u2019 t make excuses .\nInstead , they carefully consider their actions and make them based on what they believe is best .\nThey know that when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your intentions .\n11 .\nNot believing in themselves .\nIf you don \u2019 t believe in yourself , no one else will .\nAnd even if they do , if you don \u2019 t believe in yourself already , you won \u2019 t likely allow their support to do anything for you .\nEverything starts from within .\n12 .\nOnly fueling up on junk food .\nI am not saying that high-achievers don \u2019 t eat junk food sometimes .\nIn a balanced diet , it \u2019 s okay to snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly , high achievers know that crappy food makes you feel crappy .\n13 .\nComparing themselves to others .\nWith the rise of social media , it has become increasingly popular for people to compare themselves to others .\nHowever , those who aim high know that the comparison game is a trap .\nSomeone once told me , \u201c If you are looking back , you can not effectively move forward , \u201d and that is one of the most insightful things I have ever heard .\nAnd it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back ?\nIt does nothing for us .\n15 .\nDoing things they know they don \u2019 t or won \u2019 t enjoy .\nWhen a friend calls you up and asks you to go out somewhere , but you would rather be working towards your goals , it can be hard to say no .\nHowever , high achievers realize when they should say no .\nThey know that without sacrifice , they won \u2019 t be able to achieve their goals .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

have shown that around 13 million people deal with post-traumatic stress disorder worldwide .\nWhen we take into account the numbers of undiagnosed people , we can see that the actual number likely well exceeds that number .\nTrauma is different for each of us , with every person experiencing it differently .\nAnd when trauma is left unresolved , it can cause a myriad of issues , from interpersonal relationship problems to mood instability , and even psychosis .\nThe good news is , there are many ways to seek healing and begin supporting your journey towards finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts , here are 4 practical ways to do just that .\nGrounding is one of the most powerful things to help with trauma , at least for me .\nHonestly , grounding and mindfulness have helped me more than anything .\nAnd experts seem to agree .\nGrounding is a good technique for when you are disassociating or enduring flashbacks , or anxiety from your trauma .\nWhen these feelings come on , try these : -Run water over your hands : Simply turn on the cold water , and allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBring your attention to the cold water hitting each part of your hand , and then turn the water to warm .\nContinue until you feel calm again .\n-Walk around : Stand up and go for a walk .\nYou don \u2019 t have to walk around the block or anything like that , but simply walking outside for a breath of fresh air helps a lot .\n-Breathe : Inhale to four , hold for three , then exhale for four .\nFor bonus points , try to refocus your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after each set .\nMindfulness is such an underrated practice .\nWhen you have recently undergone trauma , it completely rewires your brain .\nIt can push you so deep into your mind , that nothing seems real anymore .\nWhen you are having a hard time getting out of your head , try this technique : Find 5 things you can see .\nLook around your environment and become aware of it .\nPick out things you wouldn \u2019 t usually notice .\nFind 4 things you can feel .\nWhat do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your skin , a couch cushion nearby , or whatever is available to you .\nMake sure you do this mindfully .\nFind 3 things you can hear .\nListen for fans , birds chirping , the air conditioner coming on or turning off .\nAnd truly listen to the sounds .\nFind 2 things you can smell .\nOftentimes , we get so caught up in our minds , that smells around us can go unnoticed .\nTake a moment to pick out 2 .\nFind 1 thing you can taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about a taste that is already in your mouth , or eat a snack or some gum .\nAs children , we learn to self-soothe .\nBut there again , when you are traumatized , it rewires your brain and the way you handle trauma .\nIf you are having a hard time regulating your emotions , it may help to teach yourself some self-soothing techniques .\nHere are a few : \u2013 Carry a sensory toy in your purse or backpack with you , and when you feel like your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet space and play with it .\nI like using fidget spinners , playdough , and crystals , but you can use whatever is calming to you .\n\u2013 Hug yourself : cross your right arm over your chest , with your hand near your heart .\nCross your left hand over your right shoulder and gently squeeze .\nIt may sound crazy , but it works .\nAccording to Gabby Bernstein , who is a best-selling author and trauma expert , you can use a technique similar to what EMDR therapists use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprocessing ) is a therapeutic practice that can help you tap into your mind .\nEven without going to therapy , you can use a similar technique .\nShe says to turn on some binaural EMDR music ( you can find it on YouTube ) and listen to it for 20 minutes while you vent on paper .\nYou don \u2019 t even have to list anything about your trauma , just write about your current state of mind .\nShe says after that , take 20 minutes to meditate by simply laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while focusing on your breathing .", "author":

introvert in an extrovert \u2019 s world is exhausting .\nAnd while to another introvert , introverted behaviors might be normal , to an outsider looking in , many of our traits seem alien .\nIt took me a long time to realize this very fact .\nI spent much of my life not thinking much of my introverted nature .\nIt was what came naturally to me , so I didn \u2019 t question it much .\nThe older I have gotten , the more I realize how different an introvert is from an extrovert .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more extroverted , but because it \u2019 s simply against my nature , it \u2019 s not something that I have ever been able to adhere to very much .\nNow , I have accepted my introvertedness and made peace with it .\nWhich has got me thinking a lot lately .\nOne of the things that have popped in my mind , is the different traits we empaths have that others don \u2019 t understand .\nHere are some I thought were worth mentioning .\n1 .\nWe are quiet around most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Introverts tend to be quiet around people they don \u2019 t know well , or people they aren \u2019 t used to .\nFor newbies , we may seem to be anti-social or even rude , but that isn \u2019 t the case .\nWe have to get adjusted to new people and be around them regularly before we get comfortable enough to open up .\n2 .\nWe would rather spend time alone than surrounded by people .\nWhile most people do not too much care about being alone , we introverts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way .\nWhen it comes to a big club filled with people , versus a night at home chilling with our family or by ourselves , we are almost always going to choose the latter .\n3 .\nIt \u2019 s not that we are anti-social , we are socially selective .\nThe term introvert should never be mistaken for anti-social .\nWe are not anti-social .\nOn the contrary , we love people fiercely .\nBut , we are pretty particular about who we choose to get close to .\n4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after social events .\nAfter a long weekend of social activities and interactions , we need time to ourselves .\nBecause we aren \u2019 t naturally inclined to be extroverted , when we have interacted with large groups or for extended periods , we can get a bit burned out .\n5 .\nWe like deep conversation and don \u2019 t too much care for small talk .\nPerhaps one of the biggest pet peeves of an introvert is small talk .\nSince many people socialize and interact this way , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say during small talk discussions , most people think we are weird .\nIf you really want to see an introvert open up , discuss a deep topic , like the universe .\nIn large crowds , introverts get easily overstimulated .\nEspecially in environments where we have to socialize more than necessary , or are surrounded by social pressure .\n7 .\nWe like small friend

understand and obtain knowledge .\nHowever , it goes far deeper than that .\nEmotional intelligence is a facet of intelligence that involves our understanding and ability to manage our emotions .\nWhile it has been long understood that men tend to lean towards an intelligent woman , you don \u2019 t often hear much discussion of why they prefer emotionally intelligent women .\nWhen it comes to a long-term relationship , one that is heading towards commitment , or at least a continued long-term bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women .\nAnd for good reason : emotional intelligence is fundamental to a healthy relationship .\nHere are 15 reasons why men prefer emotionally intelligent women in a long-term relationship .\nEmotionally intelligent women do not play games .\nThey are clear on their expectations .\nAnd when they say they are going to do something , they stand by that .\nEmotionally intelligent women understand that there are two sides to a relationship .\nAnd while they may have a will of their own , they also know that sometimes , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit to find common ground .\nIn turn , disagreements that would likely cause a major fight in a relationship find a resolution quickly with an emotionally intelligent woman .\n3 .\nThey are a partner , not an adversary .\nIn a relationship , one of two things will happen : either a fight will divide the couple , or disagreements will bring them together .\nIt \u2019 s important to not want to win but to want to work together as a team .\nEmotionally intelligent women realize this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies .\nEmotionally intelligent women don \u2019 t act childish .\nThey don \u2019 t obsess or act jealous or act clingy over their partners .\nWhile a clingy or jealous love is fine for a fling , it just simply won \u2019 t work in a long-term relationship .\n5 .\nThey are easier to communicate with .\nEmotionally intelligent women are master communicators .\nThey understand how to listen , and they know how to respond in an empathetic way .\nThey aren \u2019 t pushy or argumentative all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are easier to communicate with .\nSelf-awareness is so important in a relationship .\nA lot of times , we can become biased to only see our side of things , because that is the side that we are standing on .\nHowever , emotionally intelligent women can see when they are wrong , and understand how their actions and behaviors could be viewed by their partner .\nEmotionally intelligent women make great listeners .\nAnd it isn \u2019 t just that they are great at hearing what other people have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in the conversation .\nBoundaries are important in relationships , because they provide barriers and limitations , to ensure lines don \u2019 t get crossed .\nEmotionally immature women ( and men alike ) don \u2019 t often respect boundaries or understand how to create them .\nAn emotionally intelligent woman does understand and respect boundaries .\nHaving a higher level of emotional intelligence also provides people with the ability to view things from an ethical standpoint .\nBecause they are aware of their own emotions and the emotions of others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the difference between what \u2019 s right and what \u2019 s wrong .\nWhile most women are naturally more empathetic than men , not all women are empathetic .\nEmotionally immature women tend to lack empathy , without often realizing it .\nHowever , an emotionally intelligent woman is extremely empathetic and pays attention to their partner \u2019 s feelings and emotions .\nAn emotionally intelligent woman knows that it \u2019 s a waste of time to sit around complaining and being negative .\nShe knows that by doing so , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than acting to make it better .\n12 .\nThey experience higher relationship satisfaction with an emotionally intelligent woman .\nIn a 15-year longitudinal study carried out by Dr. James Parker , he found something interesting .\nWhen observing people throughout their young adulthood and into middle adulthood , he found that emotional intelligence was the main predictor of relationship satisfaction and the length of the relationship with the same partner .\n13 .\nThey are curious about their partners .\nEmotionally intelligent women never stop being curious about their partners .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand their partner on a deeper level .\nAnother great thing about emotionally intelligent women is that they are self-sufficient .\nThey don \u2019 t depend on their partner to validate them or make them feel whole , they feel that on their own .\nThey understand a healthy relationship doesn \u2019 t work under codependency .\nEmotionally intelligent women do not enter into a relationship they don \u2019 t intend to stay in .\nWhen they are in a relationship , they consider it a commitment .\nAnd when times get tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , rather than running away at the sign of

victim .\nPay attention to this .\n2 .\nThey pretend to be someone they are not .\nNarcissists like to wear a mask or a facade of who they want the world to believe they are .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl

@ @ @ @ @ @ be on my side , \u201d is the like of what they will say to convince you .\nNarcissists are magicians of reality .\nThey have an impeccable talent for leaving things out , and painting reality in such a way that you would have to believe they are the good guys .\nHowever , upon further examination , all those lies become exposed .\nNarcissists are known for love-bombing .\nUpon

well .\nI \u2019 ll list some of both .\nHere are 12 ways narcissists change you ( the good and the bad . )\n1 .\nYou begin to accept things you wouldn \u2019 t have accepted before .\nFor most people who end up being a victim of narcissistic abuse , they once thought they would never put up with the behaviors of a narcissist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat me that way , \u201d they say .\nThen , they meet

real them .\nThey were so kind and loving before.\n\u201d 2 .\nYou defend the narcissist and their abuse .\nWhen other people bring up the fact that the narcissist is abusing you , you may find yourself coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , you know something is off , it can be hard not to defend someone you love .\n3 .\nYour sense of self is lost .\nThroughout the relationship with the narcissist , the narcissist will work to tear you down and break you .\nThey will put you through experiences you \u2019 ve never endured before , and work to undermine your sense of self .\nIn the beginning , narcissists will build you up .\nHowever , not long after , they will begin belittling you and emotionally abusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withholding affection , stonewalling you , or giving you the silent treatment .\nIn turn , your self-esteem will be shattered .\nNarcissists don \u2019 t have ordinary conflicts .\nConflict with a narcissist can reach physical levels , in which they will physically harm you .\nAt the very least , they will verbally and emotionally assault you .\nThis can be very traumatic , and in turn , will cause you to fear conflict .\n6 .\nYou have a hard time trusting others .\nIt can be hard to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you one of the worst sides of humanity .\nAnd because of their abuse , you will likely have a hard time believing anyone is good .\nAnd because you ended up falling prey to the narcissist , you will begin to doubt yourself .\nThe words of the narcissist will also reverberate throughout your inner dialogue , which will only add to your self-doubt .\n8 .\nYou learn to trust in yourself .\nAfter leaving the narcissist and beginning your journey towards healing , you will finally begin to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain back will be far more than you ever had in yourself , because you survived the narcissist .\n9 .\nYou realize how much boundaries matter .\nAfter having someone invade all of your boundaries for so long , you will realize just how important boundaries are .\nNot only that , but how important it is to stand by your boundaries .\n10 .\nYou learn how to cope with grief .\nAfter you leave the narcissist , you will endure a cycle of grieving .\nBecause you loved them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , even if they did cause you harm .\nIt will take time , but through this , you will learn how to cope with grief .\nDuring the relationship with the narcissist , it \u2019 s likely that they worked to isolate you from others .\nOnce you have let go of them , you will begin to rebuild your support system , stronger than ever .\nAnd through those real human connections , you will learn what healthy relationships are again .\n12 .\nYou are more careful about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest lessons you will learn when letting go of a

the writer included photo evidence .\nIn relationships , $ ex and intimacy start hot and heavy , and over time , it can start to dwindle for several reasons .\nOne Reddit user throwwwwaway29 took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd you will not believe what her husband did in response to their dwindling love life .\nAccording to throwwwwaway29 , \u201c My husband [ M26 ] and I [ F26 ] have been together for 5 years , married for 2 of those years .\nWe just bought a house 5 months ago .\nNo kids yet .\nOur lives have been crazy busy though .\nWe spent all spring renovating our new house .\nAt my job I was given nearly double my usual workload after some of my colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight in the winter and have been busting my ass at the gym to get rid of it.\n\u201d \u201c Yesterday morning , while in a taxi on the way to the airport , Husband sends a message to my work email which is connected to my phone .\nHe \u2019 s never done this , we always communicate in person or by text .\nI open it up , and it \u2019 s a sarcastic diatribe , basically saying he won \u2019 t miss me for the 10 days I \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the times he has tried to initiate $ ex since June 1st , with a column for my \u201c excuses \u201d , using verbatim quotes of why I didn \u2019 t feel like having $ ex at that very moment .\nAccording to his \u2018 document \u2019 , we \u2019 ve only had $ ex 3 times in the last 7 weeks , out of 27 \u201c attempts \u201d on his part.\n\u201d \u201c This is a side of him I have never seen before \u2013 bitter , immature , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d been acting normal the whole time , maybe a little standoff-ish in the last week .\nCompletely out of left field .\nOur $ ex life HAS tapered in the last few months , but isn \u2019 t that allowed ?\nWe are adults leading busy , stressful lives .\nI cook for him , I do his laundry , I keep our house clean and tidy .\nIt \u2019 s not like our $ ex life was going to be this way FOREVER , it was a temporary slow-down due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phoning him 3-4 times before getting on the plane \u2013 no answer .\nWhen I landed in my destination city , I tried calling 2 more times \u2013 no answer .\nI texted him saying we needed to talk , and he needed to call me at his earliest convenience .\nNo response .\nHe \u2019 s never intentionally ignored my communications before .\nI pretty much stayed inside my hotel all evening waiting by the phone , then cried myself to sleep.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s now morning and he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am supposed to be out visiting clients for the next 9 days on behalf of my company , and I am an emotional wreck .\nWhy is he putting me through this ?\nWhat the hell am I supposed to do ?\n\u201d Here is the spreadsheet .\nThe responses to this post came from either side .\nHere are a few I thought were worth mentioning .\nLol , you guys think this was an attempt for the husband to seduce OP ?\nThe email is that of a man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who encountered so much unaknowledged rejections that he needs to count them .\nLet \u2019 s put it this way , he started documenting $ ex attempts 7 weeks ago .\nWhen do you think the $ ex actually \u2018 tapered off \u2019 ?\nI \u2019 m guessing several months before that .\nI really don \u2019 t believe it was as out of the blue as OP would like us believe .\nFor the sake of your sanity in dealing with clients for nine days , reply back with an email .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ his email was pretty lame , he is probably fearing that the past 7 weeks are not only temporary but a new way of things .\nTell him you love him , things have been crazy with all of the stuff going on , but you will work it out .\nAnd for your sake , even though you guys have a lot of stuff going on , you have to enjoy life .\nMake evenings together \u201c your thing \u201d .\nMake dinner after the gym but leave him the dishes while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get into something comfortable and just relax and enjoy your night together .\nWatch TV , have $ ex , snuggle .\nMarried life gets busy .\nWhen my kids were little , my grandmother told me that housework will always wait for you .\nI always spent evenings with my kids making dinner , giving them a bath , reading to them etc .\nYour evenings together are as important as anything else in life , maybe more so .\nCut yourself some slack , and him too .\nHope it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wholeheartedly on everything you said , this was thrown on her just as she was leaving for a business trip .\nIt would have been better if he had sent an email or text that said \u201c we need to talk when you get home \u201d or waiting until she was on her way home to send this email .\nAnother thing that strikes me is that they don \u2019 t seem to communicate at all .\nI don \u2019 t know anyone that goes on a business trip that doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day .\nI know the circumstances are dictating the lack of communication right now , but it doesn \u2019 t sound like they would be looking forward to calling each other if things were otherwise \u201d normal \u201d for them .\nIf that \u2019 s true , and I have no reason to doubt it is , then I can completely understand why he is feeling unloved , bitter , and frustrated .\nNot excusing his immature , passive-aggressive actions , but being denied 24 out of 27 attempts is about equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNow you know how it feels to be unloved and left on your own .\nI hope that is all he is trying to convey and not out banging hookers while you are gone .\nHave $ ex with your husband !\nBut at this point , she \u2019 s trying to reach out to understand his concerns , but he \u2019 s not picking up anymore .\nSure , there are excellent ways to bring up dead bedrooms , but bringing it up in such a nasty manner and then not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d be panicking at what was going on ( or down ! )\nback home !\nHonestly , I can see this from both sides .\nBut , I tend to agree with many of the commenters who voiced that there seems to be no communication .\nI understand where he \u2019 s coming from , but his approach leaves a lot to be desired .\nPerhaps if he said this person to person , and no while she was away on business ,

professor at the California Institute of Technology .\nHe spoke candidly with Express and said that for there to be an afterlife , there would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our physical body , and according to him this simply doesn \u2019 t exist .\nWhen it comes down to it , he says our consciousness exists because of the atoms and electrons which power our mind .\nOnce the physical body dies , Carrol says that these particles cease to work .\n\u201c Claims that some form of consciousness persists after our bodies die and decay into their constituent atoms face one huge , insuperable obstacle : the laws of physics underlying everyday life are completely understood , and there \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the information stored in our brains to persist after we die.\n\u201d To support his claims , he points to Quantum Field Theory , which says there is one field for each type of particle .\nTo put this in even simpler terms , electrons have their field , photons have their field , and so on .\nIn an article written in Scientific American , Carrol says , \u201c If it \u2019 s really nothing but atoms and the known forces , there is clearly no way for the soul to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after death , to put it mildly , requires physics beyond the Standard Model .\n\u201c Most importantly , we need some way for that \u2018 new physics \u2019 to interact with the atoms that we do have .\n\u201c Within QFT , there can \u2019 t be a new collection of \u2018 spirit particles \u2019 and \u2018 spirit forces \u2019 that interact with our regular atoms , because we would have detected them in existing

general .\nI tend to be a \u2018 look on the bright side , \u2019 type of gal myself , so to be honest , I don \u2019 t know if I buy what he says or not .\nIt most definitely is interesting , but he

personality trait , it \u2019 s a literal disorder .\nThose who have the disorder can experience several symptoms including : \u2013 Suicidal ideation \u2013 Self-harming tendencies \u2013 Tumultuous relationships \u2013 Emotional instability \u2013 Disassociation \u2013 Uncontrollable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviors \u2013 Intense fears of abandonment \u2013 Rapid changes in identity And while those who have the disorder typically have a combination of the above , some of these symptoms ( fits of rage ) are typically prevalent .\nWhen it comes to relationships , they can be extremely intense for someone with BPD .\nOne BPD expert , Sarah Kroesser , M.

with a friend or partner , and something is said that makes them feel disrespected they may sit and think about it for days .\nAnd then , suddenly , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and never speak to them again .\nOne of the core concerns someone with BPD has is being abandoned .\nThey are often so afraid of real or even imagined abandonment that at the slightest thought that their partner or friend is pulling away , they lose control over their emotions .\nFor example , a boyfriend may be busy with work and not able to call his girlfriend .\nAfter she tries to call him twice and texts him three times , she decides he must be leaving her .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongings outside .\nThose who have BPD are considered to be extremely sensitive .\nA situation that would bring a normal person joy causes elation in someone with BPD , while an emotionally difficult situation may cause them to spiral into a pit of depression .\nFeeling things so intensely and constantly having your nervous system on guard is exhausting and overstimulating .\nSo , if someone with BPD is already feeling edgy and anxious- the slightest thing , such as a comment or action can send them over the edge .\nThose @ @ @

who the narcissist is in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fakest .\n4 .\nThey refuse to accept responsibility for their actions .\nNarcissists do not feel remorse .\nIf they do wrong by you , they won \u2019 t likely apologize and if they do , it \u2019 s not because they are sorry , it \u2019 s because they want to manipulate you into believing they care .\nIf you listen closely to the narcissist , they believe they know everything .\nIn fact , they are an expert in every field and a have mastered it all .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all up .\nNarcissists believe they are entitled to anything they want .\nIf someone has something nice , they get jealous .\nSome will even get so entitled they will try to steal it or destroy it .\nThey can not stand to see other people do well , especially if they are doing better than them .\nNarcissists are extremely manipulative .\nThey will go to great lengths to manipulate others , including lying , guilt-tripping and even gaslighting .\nIf they want something , they won \u2019 t stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about control .\nNarcissists do not understand nor comply with boundaries .\nIf you draw a line in the sand , they will step right over it .\n9 .\nThey can not be reasoned with .\nIf you \u2019 ve ever tried to reason with a narcissist , then you know exactly what I mean .\nThere is no way to reason with one , no matter how much logic and

that ghosts are energetic beings , much like ourselves .\nHowever , because they have passed on , they don \u2019 t create the energy , they have to tap into sources to be able to manifest and move around .\nIf you are sensing something is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinking , only to return to normal , then it \u2019 s likely you have a ghost trying to make contact .\nThis one can go many different ways .\nWhile some report pleasant smells that remind them of their loved ones that have passed , others say they smell something rotten .\nThe main difference here is that a positive spirit will likely smell pleasant , whereas a poltergeist will smell putrid , almost like sulpher .\nAnimals can sense spirits , much like children , or adults that are being targeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs can see them much more clearly .\nYou can scour the internet for paranormal videos , and in many of them , animals can be seen randomly acting strangely for no reason at all , barking , hiding in the corner , and even attacking the air .\n6 .\nA feeling that someone is watching you .\nMost people who experience a haunting explain that they felt like something was watching them when it began .\nI have to say that I agree with this one .\nIt was so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave my own home in the middle of the night because I could feel a presence around me .\nAnd last but not least , strange sounds .\nSome say they hear people talking , while others report hearing music that is coming from no known source .\nOthers even hear babies crying , animals making sounds , or strange scratching , however , when they investigate , they can not find a source .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/7-signs-of-a-ghostly-presence-in-your-home/", "published": "Thu, 24 Mar 2022 03:12:05 +0000",

the subject of various research and debate is how narcissists impact their children .\nNarcissism or narcissistic personality disorder is a cluster B personality disorder .\nIn the diagnostic and statistical manual for psychology and psychiatry , there are two types of disorders : mental disorders and personality disorders .\nWhile mental disorders are easily treated with medication , personality disorders are oftentimes more resilient to medication and treatment .\nNarcissism , much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of empathy , and a troubling pattern of abusive behaviors in interpersonal relationships .\nNarcissists tend to hold a grandiose and superior sense of themselves , holding their own needs and desires above everything else .\nOther symptoms of narcissism include manipulative behaviors , a sense of entitlement , and a constant need for admiration .\nFor those who are tied to the narcissist , these traits can be very harmful .\nAnd unfortunately , when a narcissist has a child and raises them , these effects can be detrimental .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good parent , there is a need to be selfless and more importantly to have empathy for another .\nWithout this , children are treated as an extension of the self .\nAnd sadly , because narcissists are inherently abusive by nature , their children are often emotionally and physically abused and neglected .\nIn turn , their children feel unacknowledged .\nTheir feelings are invalidated , and they are valued by what they do for their parent , rather than given unconditional love .\nThey are taught that their appearance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd they become fearful of their abuse and volatile parent .\nIn many cases , children raised in this way develop addiction problems , mental illnesses like post-traumatic stress disorder , and grow into repeating the same relational patterns they experienced as a children .\nBecause they grow so accustomed to constant drama and abuse , they subconsciously seek out these patterns in their future adult relationships .\nAnd while may heal and escape the cycle of abuse and trauma , some , unfortunately , grow into who their parents were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who end up taking care of the child , rescuing them from the narcissist , the main endeavor becomes empathy , which according to Psychology Today is the opposite of narcissism .\nIf you or someone you love has been raised or hurt by a narcissist , please understand that there is healing available for these children .\nIf you are the child of a narcissist , and you recognize what

look back to my childhood and compare it to modern times , it doesn \u2019 t take a lot of digging to realize that everything has changed .\nAnd while some things have changed for the better , it seems that society as a whole is moving on a downward trajectory .\nSo what gives ?\nHonestly , there are a plethora of reasons and changes that could be cited to further prove the idea that our society is growing increasingly toxic .\nThe most ironic part of our society growing increasingly toxic , at least to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at social media and the media in general , it seems that the word \u2018 toxic \u2019 has become quite a buzzword .\nSo , if we are becoming more aware of what is toxic , and what is normal and healthy , why are continually becoming more and more toxic ?\nI will explore this topic below .\nWith the rise of social media platforms like Facebook , Twitter and Instagram , we have also had a rise in social media influencers .\nBy simply logging into Instagram or Facebook , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves beyond recognition to portray the illusion of perfection .\nBecause the mind often believes what it sees on a subconscious level , when we look at these images , we begin to compare ourselves to something that doesn \u2019 t exist .\nIn turn , it does a major number on our self-esteem and mental health .\nNot only that , but if you go a step further , many of these influencers are paid to promote products , ranging anywhere from weight-loss quick fixes to makeup and beyond .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , and oftentimes , you are being sold products that either don \u2019 t work , are horrible for you , or are a scam .\nBefore social media , people had to use their phones to communicate or they had to meet up in public .\nAs the years have gone by , fewer people communicate in person and more and more people communicate primarily over social media .\nWe have an entire generation of children and teens who have grown up on their computers , and rarely ever socialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illnesses ranging from anxiety disorders to personality disorders have steadily risen .\nAnd unfortunately , even though social media is referred to as social media , it seems that more and more people are becoming less and less social .\nAnother interesting change in our society , which I would barter , has a lot to do with social media as well as identity politics .\nPeople no longer hold beliefs as merely beliefs , instead , our beliefs ( including politics ) have become who we are .\nThere is no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate ) thought , and instead , rational thinking has been replaced with extreme fundamentalism .\nPeople can no longer have open-minded conversations because their political or religious views are now their identity .\nWhen someone disagrees with them , they take this as a hit to who they are as a person , and it causes a major divide among people .\nThe great George Carlin once said that he enjoyed people on an individual basis .\nPeople are great when they are in smaller groups or by themselves .\nIn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rational .\nHowever , when you get a group of people together , and one or more of them begins egging on the crowd , the others and the whole group are far more likely to act in a toxic manner .\nThink of someone inciting a crowd at a riot .\n5 .\nThe breakdown of the family unit .\nThere is no denying how much the family unit has changed , especially in the western world .\nWhat \u2019 s worse , is that according to research cited by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsible for 90 % of the world \u2019 s poverty .\nAdditionally , with the rise of the disintegration of the family unit , childhood mental illness , addiction , and suicide have been on the rise as well .\nWe are what we consume .\nThis could apply literally to food , and also to the rise of meaningless content spread throughout the internet .\nMore and more films and television shows show meaningless violence , and some even go as far to glorify the anti-hero mentality .\nBy simply scrolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel pranks , belligerent and hostile behavior , and honestly , content that is a total cluster f*ck .\nIn the documentary the Social Dilemma , various ex-founders of social media platforms explain how social media algorithms are used to put us each in an echo chamber .\nPut simply , we are constantly faced with content that matches the content we look at , giving us no other side view to compare or to critically think .\nGoing even further , much of the content we are given is the extreme view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even further from opposing views .\nIn turn , people continue to become more and more divided against dissenting views and opinions .\nThis may spark a bit of controversy , but victim culture seems to be on the rise as well .\nWith more and more people failing to take responsibility for their actions and their own lives , we are beginning to notice that people are far more likely to pawn their bad behaviors and lifestyles off on anyone but themselves .\nWhen people view themselves as victims , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and change things , because the responsibility lies on the shoulders of everyone but themselves .\nFor the past few decades , and most especially since the pandemic , technology addiction has continued to rise .\nAnd for good reason , social media and technology are designed in a way that keeps you coming back for more .\nMuch like injecting a hit of heroin , picking up your phone and scrolling through social media provides an immediate hit of dopamine .\nAnd the more you engage with it , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Psychology Today , they cite research that indicates that 70 % of modern students are scoring higher on narcissism and lower on empathy than the average student merely 30 years ago .\nIf you know what narcissism is , then you already realize why this is a disaster for society .\nIf you don \u2019 t , imagine a culture of self-obsessed , manipulative , and egotistical individuals who are growing increasingly more interested in their desires .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

?\n\u201d And while we may not have all of the answers , scientists have recently found that death may not be as cut and dry as we all may have thought .\nMany of us have heard the notion that our life flashes before our eyes as we die .\nOthers talk of crossing over from life into the afterlife , and some even say there is light at the end of a tunnel .\nWe all have ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments , but what happens ?\nFor a long time , scientists have worked to provide answers to this very question .\nAnd up until recently , we didn \u2019 t know that the mind continued to work consciously , even after our heart had stopped .\nOne way scientists have observed this is by studying the body and the brain just moments after cardiac arrest .\nWhile many use the terms \u201c cardiac arrest \u201d and \u201c heart attack \u201d interchangeably , they are not the same .\nWhen we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from working due to a blockage that causes part of the heart to die , while the heart continues to beat .\nWhen we go into cardiac arrest , the signals that push our heart to work are disrupted , causing the heart to stop beating before we die .\nAccording to Dr. Sam Parnia , death is typically defined by the stopping of the heart .\n\u201c Technically speaking , that \u2019 s how you get the time of death \u2014 it \u2019 s all based on the moment when the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science .\nThen , blood is no longer able to circulate to our brain , which causes brain function to come to a halt .\nIn turn , our brain stem reflexes , gag reflex , pupil reflex , and every other bodily reflex also come to a halt .\nStudies have shown us that when animals die , there is a surge in brain activity in the moments directly after death .\nParnia says that many people experience consciousness on some level in their final moments .\n\u201c They \u2019 ll describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll describe having awareness of full conversations , of visual things that were going on , that would otherwise not be known to them , \u201d he said .\nAdditionally , he explains that medical and nursing staff verified the claims , while in awe that their technically dead patients could recall those details .\nCurrently , Parnia , along with his colleagues are studying what happens in regards to consciousness after death .\nTo do this , they are observing those who have suffered from cardiac arrest , spanning across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way that a group of researchers might be studying the qualitative nature of the human experience of \u2018 love , \u2019 for instance , we \u2019 re trying to understand the exact features that people experience when they go through death because we understand that this is going to reflect the universal experience we \u2019 re all going to have when we die , \u201d he explained .\nOn top of taking down experiences from the participants , they are also observing brain data during cardiac arrest .\n\u201c At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind and consciousness in the context of death , to understand whether consciousness becomes annihilated or whether it continues after you \u2019 ve died for some time \u2014 and how that relates to what \u2019 s happening inside the brain in real-time , \u201d Parnia says .\nHowever , this is not the first time scientists have recorded brain activity after death .\nDoctors from a Canadian intensive care unit observed that one person had brain activity for up to 10 minutes after being taken off of life support .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand out above anything else is that

Kids Without Realizing It", "content": "Parents have much more influence over their children , and who they turn out to be , than most realize .\nAnd no matter how much we may think we know , at the end of the day , there are certain parenting behaviors and traits that come with catastrophic consequences .\nPsychologists have known for a long time that the actions of our parents can impact our overall life in a major way .\nWhile parenting isn \u2019 t the easiest job in the world , there is most definitely a difference between striving to do your best and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to cause detrimental harm to your child .\nAnd knowledge is power .\nBelow , I have listed the traits of toxic parents that can cause serious harm to a child in the long term .\nToxic parents mistake discipline with punishment and use hard punishments to control their children .\nRather than teaching their children how to navigate through life , they rule through fear and control .\nUltimately , this destroys a child \u2019 s bond with their parent and makes them untrusting when it comes to people .\n2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child \u2019 s life .\nMany toxic and narcissistic parents want to have control over every aspect of their child \u2019 s life .\nEven well into adulthood , they won \u2019 t allow their children to have a life of their own , and ultimately use money and other bribes to maintain that control .\nWhen they feel like they might be losing control , they begin issuing threats to take back the reigns .\n3 .\nThey expect their children to live up to unrealistic standards .\nNarcissists hold unrealistic standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most especially their children .\nRather than viewing their kids as human beings with needs and feelings of their own , they view their kids as an extension of themselves .\nIn their mind , if their child is imperfect , it reflects poorly on them , and they won \u2019 t stand for that .\nToxic parents can be extremely cruel .\nInstead of being empathetic and supportive , they are cold and callous .\nAnd if their child is not doing what they want , they resort to belittling them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our job is to help our children to navigate through their emotions .\nUnfortunately , toxic parents do not do that .\nInstead , because they aren \u2019 t equipped to handle their own emotions , they invalidate their child for having emotions .\nExamples of this might be if you went to your parent with an emotional issue and they told you to \u201c Stop being so sensitive .\nJust get over it !\n\u201d 6 .\nThey compare their children to others .\nAnother method of control used by toxic parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parents will mean any harm by this one , the harm is made nonetheless .\nBy saying , \u201c Why can \u2019 t you be more like\u2026 \u201d the message being sent is that your child is not good enough .\nAnd such a statement is a self-esteem and mental health destroyer .\nToxic parents are all about manipulation , and a great tactic for manipulation is guilt-tripping .\nWhen a toxic parent doesn \u2019 t get the result they want , or their child won \u2019 t bend to their will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , I \u2019 ve done for you , you can \u2019 t just do this one thing ?\n!\n\u201d 8 .\nThey fail to provide their children with security .\nAs parents , we have many responsibilities , one of the most important being to provide our kids with a sense of security .\nHowever , toxic parents fail to do this , and oftentimes , they end up making their kids feel more insecure than secure .\n\u201c Why are you so lazy ?\n\u201d \u201c You are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that !\n\u201d \u201c Why can \u2019 t you ever do anything right ?\n\u201d These are just a few examples of how overly critical a toxic parent can be .\nAnd while we all say things we don \u2019 t mean sometimes , words have power , so be careful .\n10 .\nThey make toxic jokes at their child \u2019 s expense .\nOn the surface , a joke may seem like no big deal .\nAnd a joke isn \u2019 t .\nBut a toxic joke that digs deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a joke about their weight or their intelligence , can be extremely harmful .\n11 .\nTheir feelings and interests come first .\nWhen you become a parent , you have to learn to make your child \u2019 s needs a priority .\nUnfortunately , toxic narcissists are self-obsessed and have a difficult time putting anyone else \u2019 s needs before their own .\nIn turn , their kids are often placed last in comparison to themselves .\nToxic parents fail to establish boundaries with their children .\nRather than respecting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are entitled to step over the line , simply because of their parents .\nHowever , when it comes down to it , everyone deserves respect .",

recognize anxious behaviors in others and even in ourselves .\nWhile it \u2019 s understandable to do things without realizing them due to a mental illness like anxiety , knowing where your behaviors are rooted can help you to take charge of your life and better manage those behaviors .\nI am not saying that anyone is without error .\nPersonally , a lot of these hit home , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowledge is most definitely power .\nAdditionally , if you notice someone who has these behaviors , try to approach them with empathy and understand where their behaviors are coming from .\nYou may

in anxiety .\n1 .\nCancelling plans at the last minute .\nOftentimes , people with anxiety make plans with the best intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , and their thoughts began to spiral out , the more apprehensive they become about the outing .\nIn turn , someone with massive social anxiety is more likely to cancel plans at the last moment .\n2 .\nNot joining in on massive \u201c group \u201d outings .\nWhile those with anxiety are better prone to thrive in small groups , when invited to a major group outing , the thought of being surrounded by people can be scary .\nSome people simply prefer smaller groups , and honestly , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , if this is something you want to do , but anxiety blocks you , it may be better to face this one head-on .\n3 .\nBlowing up about something that seems small .\nFrom the outside looking in , when someone blows up out of nowhere over something seemingly minute , it may seem odd or even rude .\nBeneath the surface , in many cases , the fact of the matter is that they have become overstimulated and feel the pressure of their circumstances .\nIn turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t always mean they have bad intentions .\nWhen you are communicating with someone and they suddenly go quiet , it may seem odd .\nHowever , for those who have anxiety , there is a constant stream of thoughts going on within their mind that can be overwhelming .\nOne voice may say , \u201c You need to respond this way , \u201d and another says , \u201c No , no , this is what you need to say , \u201d while another says , \u201c No , no , that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you are rude.\n\u201d On the outside , it just looks like they are being quiet and rude when in reality , they are trying to figure out how to respond without seeming rude or disinterested .\nAnother common trait of anxiety is a lack of eye contact .\nThis one is especially so for people who have social anxiety , or people who have post-traumatic stress disorder .\nThe reason for this is that when you \u2019 ve been hurt or had people verbally and emotionally abuse you , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions to you .\nMany people take it personally when you don \u2019 t answer a call , text , or even Facebook message .\nBut , when someone doesn \u2019 t answer you , there could be a myriad of reasons behind why they haven \u2019 t including anxiety .\nAnxiety can make it hard to navigate conversations , making it easier to avoid them altogether .\nAvoidance tied to anxiety can come in many forms .\nWhen I and my husband first started dating , when we went to the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was anxious around ) I would try to be subtle in avoiding them .\nHe would make remarks about this and say that I was \u2018 snubbing \u2019 them .\nIn reality , it wasn \u2019 t that I didn \u2019 t like the person or that I intentionally wanted to be rude to them , I was just anxious .\nThis is something I have personally tried to work on , but on a bad day , it can be daunting .\nPeople who have anxiety need time to revamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in constant social interactions .\nThose who have anxiety , after a major social interaction , need a break .\nFor that reason , when invited out , someone with anxiety might make up an excuse or simply say they don \u2019 t want to go .\nBeing in an anxious situation can make your mind go into overdrive .\nDue to that , anxiety can push you to zone out , no matter how hard you fight it .\nWhen I am trying to conversate or pay attention to someone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how many times I try to put my mind back on track , sometimes it simply isn \u2019 t possible .\nBeing interrupted can be frustrating and annoying and while some people interrupt because they genuinely don \u2019 t care to listen to what you say , others may feel the pressure of anxiety and do it unintentionally .\nIt \u2019 s important to consider who is interrupting and what their mindset looks like at that moment .\nYou might be

and some telegraph operators reported electrical shocks and even fires .\nAt the time of the Carrington Event , the internet did not exist .\nHowever , if another solar storm took place on the same

5 million people without power .\nAdditionally , internet services would go down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit could come tumbling down to the ground .\nJust recently , there were a few satellites that did just this , as a result of a MILD solar storm .\nWallace is not alone in his warning .\nLast year , at the Sigcomm 2021 event , researcher Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi , who is a professor at the University

Tables on You", "content": "Narcissists are individuals who have a personality disorder known as Narcissistic Personality Disorder .\nThis disorder is characterized by selfishness , dysfunctional relational patterns , and in many cases , emotionally abusive tendencies .\nIf you \u2019 ve never encountered a narcissist , consider yourself lucky .\nFor those of us who have , we know firsthand the damage they can cause in our lives .\nOne of the most difficult aspects of dealing with a narcissist is their manipulative behaviors .\nIn most cases , they can be very good at masking their true selves until it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their behavior and manipulative tendencies is the fact that they are quite good at turning the tables on their victims .\nAnd if you don \u2019 t know what you are looking for , you likely won \u2019 t even realize what is happening .\nHere are 8 ways narcissists turn the tables by playing the victim .\nNarcissists work to undermine the perceptions of their victims through gaslighting .\nPut simply , throughout their relationships with their victim , they will make small remarks and even big ones .\nAt first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c You are too sensitive , \u201d or , \u201c Well , you are kind of crazy.\n\u201d You might even think they are joking with you .\nEventually , once they have convinced you that maybe you are crazy , they will begin flat out lying to your face .\nThis behavior can ultimately lead to making the victim believe that they are crazy , which is extremely harmful .\nNarcissists don \u2019 t just lie to everyone else , they lie to themselves .\nThey are so skilled at distorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the lies they tell .\nThat \u2019 s another reason why they are so believable because they usually genuinely believe their lies .\nA narcissist does not mind lying .\nThey will do whatever they have to do .\nto obtain the result that benefits them the most .\nThey will lie , and then lie to cover up their lie , and then lie some more .\nYou could catch them in the act , and they would still lie .\nNarcissists do not live in the same reality as everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-evolving and always changing to suit the narrative that benefits them .\nAll the way down to their personal , almost everything about them is a distortion of the truth .\nIf you catch a narcissist doing something harmful and call them out , be prepared to have them turn it around on you .\nEven worse , is that they will often do this , even if you have said nothing to them .\nFor example , a narcissistic boyfriend will likely accuse their partner of cheating , because they feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their partner must be too .\nOf course , this also applies to narcissistic girlfriends .\nNarcissists have a hard time accepting responsibility for their actions .\nIt \u2019 s just not something they are usually willing to do .\nWhen it comes time to , they often tend to say things like , \u201c Well , if you wouldn \u2019 t have done _________ , I wouldn \u2019 t have done that to you .\nSo really , it \u2019 s your fault.\n\u201d Blame-shifting removes them from having to take responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sympathy Against You More often than not , narcissists are attracted to highly empathetic people .\nThe reason is , that people who have high levels of empathy are more likely to be sympathetic to the narcissist , no matter how badly they behave .\nPerhaps one of the most useful tricks a narcissist uses to turn the tables is triangulation .\nFor example , if you and your narcissistic partner got into a fuss and you broke it off with them because you started to realize what they were about , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drag you down .\nRather than acknowledging they have done wrong , they will try

unsettling reality is that there are children out there that are not getting taken care of as they should .\nRecognizing the signs of neglect is perhaps the most important way to give a voice to a child that otherwise couldn \u2019 t get help .\nAnd while any child is susceptible to neglect , some are far more vulnerable to it than others .\nIf you are around a child and you suspect neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proper person and do whatever it is within your power to help them .\nAccording to the most notable sources , these are the signs of neglect that should never be ignored .\nWhile an absence here and there is one thing , if a child is regularly going without education ( either homeschooling or regular schooling ) then there may be another issue going on .\nIt could be that the parents aren \u2019 t supervising or making sure that their education is attended to .\nChildren are normally hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger , I mean real hunger .\nWhen a child is begging for anything they can eat , and indicating to adults that they are hungry and aren \u2019 t being fed at home , they are likely not having their nourishment needs met at home .\nA neglected child may often be sick or come down with illnesses , but never go to the doctor .\nOr , they may have cuts or other injuries that are never tended to .\nThis is a major red flag .\nAnother indicator of neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bathe regularly , and have dirt or grime on their skin .\nOr their teeth may not be brushed , and their hair left unkempt .\nIf you notice that a child doesn \u2019 t have a curfew or any consistent supervision , this is a sign of neglect .\nThey may come to school tired because they didn \u2019 t get to bed at a proper time .\nAfter all , no one enforces any type of routine .\nAdditionally , they miss school altogether or end up hanging out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things .\nWhen a child is properly cared for , their parents will ensure that they have a sweater or coat and that they aren \u2019 t wearing jeans in the middle of winter .\nConversely , they will assure that they aren \u2019 t wearing a coat and jeans when it \u2019 s blistering hot outside .\nInappropriate clothing for the weather is a tell-tell sign .\nIf you notice a child that wears the same dirty clothes regularly , this too could be a sign of neglect .\nThey may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dirt on their clothes , or if you see them regularly enough , you will likely realize they are wearing the same articles each day .\nChildren who are neglected often display behavioral problems .\nThey may act out through aggression , or be hyperactive .\nOther behavioral problems could include yelling or simply refusing to listen .\nAnother sad sign of neglect is low self-esteem .\nWhen children have parents around to tend to their needs , emotional and otherwise , they have a healthier way of viewing themselves .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , their emotional needs are often overlooked as well .\nChildren who don \u2019 t have normal dental check-ups , or glasses if they need them , or who have unattended health problems do maybe being neglected .\nIf you notice that a child is going without proper medical care , it may be time to step up and say something to someone .\nChildren who are neglected will often have clothes or shoes that do not fit them properly .\nIf you notice that a child is wearing pants that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small , or shoes that don \u2019 t fit right , it \u2019 s likely a situation of neglect .\nAnd because neglected children aren \u2019 t always fed properly , they may display signs of this through skin rashes or weight problems ( being underweight . )\nThey might also lack muscle tone or be prone to infections .\nIf you notice a neglected child , remain calm .\nIf you lose your cool and act out of sorts about the situation , the child may lose faith in you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nExplain gently to them that they are not to blame for what is happening , and do NOT interrogate them or ask a million questions .\nExpress empathy , and do not put words in their mouth .\nIf you feel like their safety is at risk , contact professionals either at their school or at your local authorities .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/12-signs-of-child-neglect-that-should-never-be-ignored/", "published": "Thu, 07 Apr 2022 01:18:11

ages of 7-17 , and used a control group of children who had not lost their parents .\nAmong the children who had experienced pediatric bereavement , they found much higher rates of depression

affect a child \u2019 s quality of life , so in a first for pediatric grief studies , we also used a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning to better capture the true magnitude of the effects of bereavement ,

transition to new schools , to new households , and the integration into a new family .\nFor those who had a single parent survive , there is also the fact that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make it much harder for them to adequately care and support their children .\nWhile it likely comes as no surprise that the impact of losing a parent is so devastating , it \u2019 s definitely something worth

simply do not care how their words affect their children , there are others that truly do want to do the best they can for their children .\nHowever , even the most well-intentioned parent can end up saying something toxic to their children without even realizing it .\nOf course , we all say things sometimes in the heat of the moment without realizing how damaging our words can be .\nDespite that , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , the better equipped we are to avoid them altogether .\nHere are 10 toxic things parents say to their children .\n1 .\nDon \u2019 t eat that , or you are going to get fat !\nWhile it doesn \u2019 t make you a bad parent to want to feed your child nourishing food , it \u2019 s better to take a different approach than to put the focus on their appearance .\nWhen you do so , you are going to give them a complex about their body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sever their relationship with food and even their self-esteem .\nThis phrase is best avoided .\n2 .\nBecause I said so , that \u2019 s why .\nMany of us heard this growing up , so what \u2019 s the problem ?\nRather than teaching your child anything valuable , this phrase is more of a power play .\nAnd the thing about power plays with kids , is that they don \u2019 t work .\nIf you need your child to do something , use it as a teaching moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen your child is feeling an emotion , and you shut them down by shaming them , the message you send is that it \u2019 s not okay to feel emotions .\nIn turn , they are always going to be apprehensive about feeling things , which isn \u2019 t going to help them at all in the long run .\nWhile something may not seem like a big deal to you , to them , it might be .\nYour child is not an extension of you , they are autonomous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goals .\n5 .\n_______ is better than you .\nThe comparison game sends a message loud and clear : You aren \u2019 t good enough , be better .\nAnd while you may not mean that , that is what your little one hears .\nBe careful with your words .\n6 .\nI do everything for you .\nAs a parent , it \u2019 s your job to do things for your child .\nThey didn \u2019 t ask to be brought into the world , so don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your responsibility as a parent to do .\n7 .\nYou did okay , but you could do better .\nWhen your child is showing effort to do something , don \u2019 t discourage them .\nCelebrate their effort and reward them .\nOtherwise , they are going to feel like nothing they do is enough .\n8 .\nYou are so lazy .\nIf your child is acting lazy , name the behavior and label it , not your kid .\nFor example , \u201c Sitting around and doing nothing all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s try to do a few things around the house.\n\u201d This emphasizes how the behavior is bad , rather than labeling them as something that can be a self-fulfilling prophesy .\n9 .\nThat \u2019 s not how you do it , here let me do it .\nIt may be tempting to jump in and do things for your child .\nHowever , doing so is only going to make them dependent on you .\nSo , be patient and show them how while allowing them to have some hands-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t know how we are going to pay the bills this month .\nIf you are going through financial difficulty , it \u2019 s best not to tell your kids .\nDr. Brad Klontz spoke with CBS News and is a psychologist .\nAccording to him , giving TMFI ( too much financial information ) involves them in things they are powerless over and will ultimately just make them anxious .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

everyone lies sometimes , and if you say otherwise , you are lying to yourself .\nHowever , there is a major difference between a pathological liar and someone who tells a little white lie from time to time .\nThe intention is everything , and that is what we will be discussing here .\nWhile some may say that a lie is a lie , the fact of the matter is , that there are many motives for lying .\nNow , don \u2019 t get me wrong , I am NOT saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut , for the sake of not lying in this article , I am going to go ahead and face that elephant in the room and just say it : we \u2019 ve all told a few lies in our life .\nNow that that \u2019 s out of the way , here are 8 reasons why people lie .\nPerhaps one of the biggest reasons why people lie is to avoid being punished .\nWhether it \u2019 s when we are being pulled over and the cop asks us how fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a husband who cheated on his wife and is trying to avoid being divorced , punishment is a major motivator .\nManipulation and lying go hand in hand .\nManipulators are known to distort the truth to get what they want , and oftentimes will spin massive webs of lies .\nUnfortunately , in many cases , manipulative lies can be extremely harmful .\nNo one likes to be embarrassed .\nAs social beings , we want to fit in and when we are in the heat of the moment and someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first instinct is to fight ( lie ) or flee the situation .\nMany opt for lying .\nThe trouble with this is that eventually , our lies catch up to us .\n4 .\nTo impress someone else .\nEgo is a very big motivator .\nWe want people to be impressed with us , however , lying to impress someone will likely not get you far .\nHowever , that doesn \u2019 t stop someone from pretending to have a better ( perceived ) job than they have or a nicer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and so forth .\nHow many of you have told a little white lie because you didn \u2019 t want to hurt someone \u2019 s feelings ?\nI \u2019 m pretty sure this is the most common reason for lying , or at least the most socially acceptable .\nBecause no one wants to tell someone they look bad or break bad news in the wrong way .\nSelf-preservation is a big incentive to lie .\nWhen a real or perceived threat comes knocking at our door , the vast majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone that we love .\nThat \u2019 s just reality .\nHere go the ego-incentivized lies again .\nBut though , some people do lie so that they can feel more superior to someone else .\nThink of the person who acts as if they have it all together , all the while judging everyone else .\nLater , everyone finds out they have been hiding a lot of very telling secrets .\nSee what I mean ?\nAnd this is what we call a pathological liar , my friends

there is a major problem .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue , because one or both of you resorts to passive aggression , or gives the silent treatment , this is also a problem .\n3 .\nThere is no healthy communication .\nHealthy communication is EVERYTHING when it comes to relationships , and not just romantic relationships , but pretty much all social interaction .\nWithout healthy communication , misunderstandings grow into a major divide .\nArguments and conflict are passed over and never discussed , and the longer that things are avoided and go undiscussed , the deeper the divide grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not normal to keep tabs on your partner and tell them how to lead their life .\nYes , it \u2019 s good to have standards and to have boundaries , but when you are hoarding over your partner like you are their parent , you are in the wrong relationship .\nAnd if your partner is treating you that way , you are in the wrong relationship .\nThere is no room for control in a healthy relationship .\n5 .\nOne or both of you are obsessive .\nI \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Facebook where people will jokingly post about their \u2018 crazy \u2019 girlfriends who get upset after they don \u2019 t text them back for 45 seconds .\nWhile the posts are a joke , what alarms me is the comments below the image , where everyone is commenting \u201c haha that \u2019 s so me !\n\u201d Guys ,

relationship is toxic .\nAnd 9 times out of 10 , if your partner is abusing you they are not going to change .\nThis might be a hot-button topic , but hear me out .\nWhen one or both partners have a substance addiction , things can get toxic real fast .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people experiencing the addiction refuse to get help .\nWhen one partner is doing all the leg work in a relationship ,

weight for an extended amount of time , it can destroy the relationship .\n9 .\nOne or both of you are keeping score .\nRelationships are supposed to be about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and growing as a team

unable to see themselves because they lack self-awareness .\nBecause of this , they are unable to change in most cases , which can make relationships and life in general quite hard .\nNarcissists hate being rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when they are rejected , they take it to a very personal level .\nNarcissists do not have patience for anything or anyone .\nAnd while they can try to hold it

unstable .\nWithout much notice , their emotions can shift from happy , to angry to sad and too panicked .\nMost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk on eggshells because of their emotional instability .\nAnd in many cases , their emotional instability can be their downfall .\nNarcissists don \u2019 t like to be perceived as weak , and to them , their vulnerability is their weakness .\nDuring the conversation , narcissists will avoid giving details about anything they believe makes them appear weak or vulnerable .\nAnd since true human connection thrives on our ability to be vulnerable with others , it is very hard for a narcissist to get close to someone else .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way or the highway.\n\u201d They don \u2019 t like when anyone disagrees with them , and whenever they are challenged , they will quickly shut down .\nOne of the aspects of narcissism , perhaps one of the biggest impairments of a narcissist is their inability to show empathy .\nThey are unable to see things from anyone

more we realize the flaws of our parents .\nNo one wants to admit their parent or parents are toxic , and no one wants to accept that their toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults .\nBut , the sooner we realize the roots of our flaws , the sooner we can begin healing from the trauma of it all .\nHere are 10 subtle ways having a toxic parent affects you into adulthood .\n1 .\nYou have trouble accepting your

.\nRather than getting the validation and encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told emotions make us weak .\nBecause of this , children who grow up with toxic parents have a hard time accepting their emotions .\nToxic parents often work to tear their children down , rather than to build them up .\nThey will make them feel as though they are unworthy of love , which over time can tear away from their self-esteem .\nBecause we are born reaching our parents for love when they don \u2019 t provide it , we are left feeling flawed or as though we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent makes you much more

intimacy with others , because it was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other relationships , we may struggle to get close because we don \u2019 t know how .\nIn a situation where children are raised healthily , they learn healthy attachment .\nWhen their parents leave them for a bit and return , they go right to their parents and are seemingly unfazed by their leaving .\nHowever , in the case of a toxic or neglectful parent , an insecure attachment style occurs .\nThis manifests either through avoidance or anxious attachment styles .\n6 .\nYou have a hard time trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people aren \u2019 t to be trusted , because we can not trust our parents , it sets a precedent in our minds .\nRather than believing that people want the best for us or that people are inherently good , we instead grow to believe that people must be bad or at the very least , are not to be trusted .\n7 .\nYou have a hard time trusting in yourself .\nWhen our parents treat us badly , and belittle us , deep down to our core , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we deserve how we are being treated and we grow to resent ourselves .\nLater in life , that distrust and sense of unworthiness only continue to linger .\nGrowing up with toxic parents can make us accustomed to toxic relationships .\nWe may become so familiar with it , that when we encounter a healthy relationship , we don \u2019 t know how to handle it , or how to accept real love .\nWhen you grow up among chaos and intense emotions , the world also feels intense and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight emotions and feelings can feel like immense pressure

oftentimes seems like an elusive concept , one that is hard to understand and even a bit abstract .\nIn one moment , we may believe we have finally obtained it , only to see it slip away , so what is

we are on a journey and once we reach happiness , we will stay there as long as we like .\nBut happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are 10 things you need to accept to be happy .\n1 .\nHappiness comes in brief moments .\nHappiness is not a permanent place in which we can live forever .\nOn the contrary , happiness comes in small blips and brief moments .\nIt \u2019 s a beautiful sunset at the end of a hard day .\nIt \u2019 s a warm chocolate chip cookie made with love by our favorite person .\nAnd it \u2019 s the little moments we often overlook because we are too busy waiting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @

that darkness that makes us appreciate the light so much more .\nAnother misconception about happiness is that if we fill our days with busy work or activities that please us .\nBut , studies have shown that meaningful activities versus activities of pleasure are far more likely to bring us true happiness .\n5 .\nYou can not compare your journey to someone else \u2019 s and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , we are surrounded by the highlight reels of anyone we want access to .\nFrom the outside looking in , we may begin to believe that everyone leads this perfect life , which in turn , can cause us to grow frustrated with our journey .\nBut , the thing is , people only show us what they want us to see , and NO ONE has a perfect life .\nWe each have our journey , so it \u2019 s pointless to compare yours to someone else .\n6 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side .\nIt \u2019 s easy to get caught up in the trap of thinking , \u201c If only I could be ______ , \u201d or \u201c If only my life

are more beneficial than others , it goes without saying that some parenting behaviors can leave a negative impact on a child .\nIn modern times , there is so much information readily available about mental health , with increasing numbers of individuals being diagnosed with anxiety disorders .\nAnxiety disorders are the most common disorders in the United States , with 40 million adults in the

physical neglect .\nHowever , there is another side of the coin : emotional neglect .\nAs parents , a major part of their job is to help their child manage their emotions and help them to feel secure and loved .\nBut , parents who fail to do this are emotionally neglectful .\nAll parents criticize sometimes , however , when a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at them in anger , they are ultimately causing them to suffer from severe anxiety .\nThe reason for this is that when everything you do is put under constant scrutiny , it causes you to become hypervigilant and on edge , afraid to do anything wrong .\nAnother word for this is helicoptering .\nPut simply , parents who always stand over their kids , watching their every move , can drastically impact how their children turn out .\nResearch published in the journal Cognitive Therapy and Research found strong links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents believe that shaming their children is effective discipline .\nHowever , experts warn against shaming , because the effects of shaming can linger , causing anxiety disorders and other emotional disorders .\nNot only that , shaming does not lead to changed behavior .\nOn the contrary , Harvard Health

reject them , or abandon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than assuming that something is off about us , they immediately believe they have done something wrong .\nProlonged rejection and neglect ultimately destroy a child \u2019 s sense of self .\nAnd can lead to deep attachment issues .\nChildren need stability .\nWithout it- a world that is already scary and filled with the unknown is made to feel a million

"title": "12 Signs of Covert Abuse You Should Never Ignore", "content": "When most of us think of what abuse looks like , we imagine something that is obvious : a woman with a black eye , a man with a bruised jaw , and any other obvious wound .\nHowever , abuse , much like anything else in this world , falls on a spectrum .\nAnd some abusers are far more covert than they are obvious .\nNow , let me be clear : covert abuse is no less damaging than obvious and outright abuse .\nActually , one could argue that it \u2019 s even worse because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman has a black eye , because her husband punched her , no sane person would argue that isn \u2019 t abused .\nBut , when someone is a victim of covert emotional abuse , they are left to battle with themselves , and in many cases , overlook the abuse , because it doesn \u2019 t seem like what they were always taught was abuse .\nIt \u2019 s important to remove the stigma of what abuse is and get clear on the reality of abuse .\nAbuse is not always physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are 12 signs of covert abuse to look out for .\nAbusers are constantly working to undermine and belittle their partners .\nThis may be in an obvious way or even a more covert form .\nOftentimes , their criticism may feel passive-aggressive- but ultimately , the message is that nothing you do is enough .\nAnother tactic of covert abusers is to use threats to manipulate .\nThere again , these threats may be obvious , or they may just simply work to intimidate you , insinuating that if you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something bad will happen to you .\nAbusers often gaslight , and this is especially prevalent among covert abusers .\nGaslighting , put simply , is when an abuser works to make their victim doubt their own version of reality .\nExamples of this , is if you called them out on doing something harmful or bad , no matter how much proof you have , and no matter if you witnessed it first hand , they will say \u201c That \u2019 s not what happened.\n\u201d or \u201c You are just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the upper hand .\nYou aren \u2019 t able to say their side , because they will either yell over you or shut down entirely and walk away , refusing to hear what you have to say .\nAbusers are also extremely cruel and callous .\nEven covert narcissists will call you names , and say awful and humiliating things to you , all the while acting as though they have done nothing wrong .\n6 .\nThey turn everything around on you .\nWhen abusers are called out , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEven their abuse is your fault .\nWhen they are exposed- they turn the tables .\nAnother trait of covert abuse is when the abuser antagonizes their victim .\nThey do this to incite an extreme reaction from their victim , so when they retaliate and lash back , they feel justified .\n\u201c If you wouldn \u2019 t have acted so crazy , I wouldn \u2019 t feel the need to _________.\n\u201d Covert abusers are extremely obsessive and controlling .\nThey go through their partner \u2019 s phones , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they tell their partner what they can do and where they can do it .\nRather than their partner being an autonomous individual , they are merely considered to be an extension of themselves .\nAnother trait of covert abuse is extreme jealousy .\nExamples of this may be if a girlfriend refuses to allow her partner to leave her sight because she is convinced he will cheat on her , even if he \u2019 s never cheated .\nOr a boyfriend who demands his girlfriend never go out with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be venturing outside of the relationship .\nLove does NOT mean ownership .\nAbusers work to isolate their victims and keep them away from the people they love most .\nThey do this in many different ways- they might flat out tell you that you need to stay away from others , or they may slowly pick away at your closest friends and family .\nIn other cases , they may initiate fights between you and your friends , causing separation to happen that you didn \u2019 t want .\n11 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEmotional abusers often find ways to belittle and humiliate their partners in front of others , even going

people , don \u2019 t realize they are toxic .\nIn fact , many toxic behaviors are so ingrained in us , either through our own experiences with our parents or by our culture , that we unconsciously live in a way that is detrimental to the well-being of our children .\nNow , don \u2019 t get me wrong , there is a difference between a person who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes the conscious decision to repave that toxic path and a toxic person who refuses to see the fault in their actions .\nIf the following sounds like you , then I implore you to think about which category you fall under .\n1

isn \u2019 t some silly philosophy that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were bored and waiting on Door Dash .\nThis theory is rooted in science .\nAnd there is something to it .\nOver the past century , scientists have worked to understand the Universe through two major theories , general relativity , and quantum mechanics .\nPut simply , general relativity is the theory that explains gravity and the movement of objects , whereas quantum mechanics work to explain how the world is composed of tiny particles that interact with one another .\nHowever , because scientists believe these two theories conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of a more general theory that would explain both .\nWhat they are working on is a theory of quantum gravity , which would effectively replace both of the current standing theories .\nBut , this task is not as easy as one would think .\nOne of the proposed theories is string theory , which tells us that instead of particles , our known universe is composed of vibrating strings that vibrate in up to 11 dimensions .\nMany scientists aren \u2019 t satisfied with string theory , though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that space and time are a network of loops .\nAnd if loop theory ended up being the theory that took the place of the others , it asserts that time doesn \u2019 t exist at all .\nAnd while science may not observe time , it doesn \u2019 t mean that time is not acknowledged .\nAs humans , one of the measures of our reality is the use of clocks , calendars , and other measurements of time .\nIf time on a quantum level was disproven , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and burn our clocks .\nWhile there isn \u2019 t a theory of couches , they exist , but other theories ( the ones that assert that everything emerges from particles ) show that couches emerge from those particles .\nThe thing about time is that as it stands , there is no way to explain whether time originates or emerges .\nSo , if time doesn \u2019 t emerge , it \u2019 s hard for science to prove that it exists , and herein lies the problem .\nHowever , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers agree that even if time didn \u2019 t exist , this likely won \u2019 t affect us beyond the theories

\u201d not \u201c diseases.\n\u201d Medicalizing addiction has not led to any management advances at the individual level .\nThe need for helping or treating people with addictions is not in doubt ,

lot of people slip into old patterns ( move backward ) and slip back into old bad habits .\nTravel plans can go awry and miscommunication is prevalent during the retrograde .\nBecause of this , it

of Gemini , its energy affects each of us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs that will be most affected by this retrograde .\nFor those whose zodiac sign is Aries , this is going to be an intense retrograde .\nBecause it will fall in your house of communication- the chaotic aspects of this retrograde are likely going to be heightened for you .\nExpect to be misunderstood and misunderstood , and if you

for gung-ho Aries .\nBecause this retrograde will move through your house of income and finance , be careful to check your electronic banking and double-check that important transaction go through .\nYou could expect to get hit with an unexpected fee or even have your bank go down when you need them most .\nA good opportunity that will come of this , though , is that if you are having a difficult time with your financial mindset , this is a major opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrograde is falling under your sign , so it \u2019 s expected that you are going to be feeling it rather

completely okay to slow down and take some time just for you , so you can get your mind back right .\nBe wary of how you approach social media during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your house of public image .\nWhile it may not be intentional , you may end up posting something that is gravely misunderstood , leading to problems among your tight-knit friend group and family .\nWith this retrograde falling under your fourth house of home and family , your family life may be a bit chaotic .\nI would expect to have some miscommunications among family members and to have important household electronics glitch out during use .\nIf you have any travel plans with family- make sure everyone has all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , otherwise , travel plans may go awry .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

only survive , but thrive .\nAnd in a world filled with information , it can be hard to discern what is useful and what is not .\nThankfully , Michele Borba , a parenting expert , psychologist , and best-selling author of \u201c Thrivers : The Surprising Reasons Why Some Kids Struggle and Others Shine \u201d provides some very useful information on how we can help our kids to flourish .\nAccording to Borba , who started her career teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain skills can ensure success .\nHere are the skills she shares : There is a major difference between self-esteem and self-confidence , despite parents often mistaking the two .\nBorba explains \u201c real self-confidence is an outcome of doing well , facing obstacles , creating solutions , and snapping back on your own.\n\u201d Rather than doing tasks for your child and solving all of their problems , Borba suggests allowing your child to overcome obstacles on their own .\nMany people mistake empathy for something that is engrained in us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a skill much like anything else .\nBorba says that children need to have an emotional vocabulary to develop deeper empathy .\nTo do this- help your child label their emotions , ask them emotional questions ( \u201c How did that make you feel ?\n\u201d ) share your feelings and point out the feelings of others .\nSelf-control is also taught- and Borba says it can be helpful to give children signals .\nExamples of this are the school bell ringing , but she says parents can develop signals and cues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your attention in one minute , \u201d or \u201c Are you ready to listen ?\n\u201d are both good cues .\n\u201c Integrity is a set of learned beliefs , capacities , attitudes , and skills that create a moral compass children can use to help them know \u2014 and do \u2014 what \u2019 s right , \u201d Borba explains .\nPart of our job in helping with this is to provide expectations to our children .\nHowever , the biggest and most important contributor is to allow them space to develop their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence .\nAnd there are many ways in which parents can spark curiosity in their children .\nExamples are providing your child with gadgets and open-ended toys .\nEven something as simple as pipe cleaners , blocks , and paper clips can open their mind to new possibilities .\nWhen children are under pressure , perseverance is what will push them through .\nOftentimes , Borba says that kids end up giving up when they feel overwhelmed .\nTo thwart this , she encourages parents to teach kids to break large tasks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more obtainable .\nOptimism is extremely beneficial because it allows children to view obstacles in a positive light , which also makes them much more likely to succeed .\nAnd optimism is something that starts with us , as parents .\nChildren pick up on how we speak to ourselves and others .\nBe careful to remain optimistic , rather than pessimistic .", "author": "Harley

understatement to say that we are misunderstood .\nFor much of my life , I did not even realize how much my introverted nature was being misunderstood .\nI figured if I had a good heart , even if I was reserved , most people would understand that I was simply an introvert .\nNow , I understand that isn \u2019 t the truth .\nI have learned over the years how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem weird , and to be upfront with the fact that I tend to be an introvert .\nIf you are like me , and your introverted nature often gets you placed in a tough spot , then you might want to read over the following .\nAnd if you are an extrovert who has an introvert as a friend , it may help you to understand their mindset to look over the following as well .\n1 .\nIntroverts are careful about the people they surround themselves with .\nIntroverts do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people .\nOn the contrary , they would rather have a few great friends who they can trust and understand , than a million that don \u2019 t understand them and only cause drama in their life .\n2 .\nThey need time alone to recharge .\nIntroverts enjoy socializing with their friends and family .\nHowever , after a social event , they need time to decompress .\nIntroverts are easily overstimulated in larger groups and sometimes even small ones .\nIf you are friends with an introvert , you have likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not that they

are sensitive to change .\nEven the slightest change can completely throw them off .\nBecause of this , the more notice of an impending change they have , the easier it is for them to prepare for it .\n5 .\nThey value loyalty above all else .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the world , but the people they value are valued on the highest pedestal .\nThey care deeply and with all of their heart , and they will stand by the ones they love , no matter what .\nTo them , quality friendships and family relationships that are loyal in nature are extremely important .\n6 .\nThey are quiet until they get to know you .\nWhen an introvert firsts meet you , they may come off as rude .\nOftentimes , they are standoffish and may even appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they get to know you , they will talk your ears off under the right circumstances .\n7 .\nThey love spending time with their friends/family , but need downtime too .\nWhile the introvert doesn \u2019 t always want to spend their days alone , because they value time with friends and family , they still need downtime .\nIf an introvert says \u2018 Sorry , not today.\n\u2019 It \u2019 s not because they don \u2019 t want to spend time with you , it \u2019 s because they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attention-seekers .\nThey abhor them .\nThey do not like attention to be on them and prefer to stay on the sidelines quietly and to themselves .\n9 .\nThey don \u2019 t answer the phone unless they know who it is .\nTo an extrovert , who loves chit-chat , it may seem odd that someone would let a call go to voicemail .\nHowever , there again

are people who value deep conversation .\nIntroverts do not care to talk about the weather or gossip .\nOn the contrary , they want to talk about the meaning of life .\nThey yearn for deep conversation .\nAnd if you want to engage an introvert , this is the way .\nIf you need to cancel plans with an introvert , they aren \u2019 t going to mind .\nYou might be worried you will hurt @ @ @

from extreme alcoholism , extreme drug abuse , or even someone with a gambling or hoarding addiction , beneath the surface , there is a trauma that has gone unresolved .\nAs a coping mechanism , those who have endured trauma will often end up avoiding people and situations which bring them any discomfort .\nThey may believe if they keep themselves isolated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfortunately , what happens is that by avoiding people altogether , they are bringing on the one thing they are trying to avoid : pain .\nThose who have endured trauma often relive their trauma through flashbacks and nightmares .\nFor a split second , they feel like they are taken back to the moment in which it happens .\nAnd triggers can be scents , names , certain music , or really anything that reminded them of the traumatic experience .\nAnother symptom of unresolved trauma is feelings of detachment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling empty or feeling separated from their body .\nIn some cases , they may not even believe they are real .\nThis is called disassociation , depersonalization , and derealization , and it \u2019 s very typical among those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder .\nWhen a major trauma occurs , it sends our nervous system on overdrive .\nThis is due to massive amounts of cortisol being released , which places us in fight or flight mode .\nIn turn , because trauma stays with

Getting Physical)", "content": "Oftentimes , when we think about showing love to our partner , some of the first things that come to mind are physical in nature .\nAnd while there is nothing wrong with getting physical , there are other , more intimate ways to show someone how much they mean to you .\nThe fact of the matter is , that while physical affection is amazing when it comes down to it , a deeper bond is necessary to keep the love alive .\nAt the end of the day , there is much more to a lasting relationship than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t get me wrong \u2013 there \u2019 s nothing wrong with making physical love .\nBut , when you think about it , there are hundreds of ways to make love without ever getting naked .\nHere are 12 of them .\n1 .\nDo something nice for your partner .\nOne of the best ways to show affection is to do something nice for them .\nIt doesn \u2019 t have to be a big thing- it can be something simple .\nGood examples of this are to filling up their tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch at work .\nBuying something you know your partner will love is a really simple but sweet way to do something loving for them .\nThere again , it doesn \u2019 t have to be some major show of love , or something expensive .\nOn the contrary , if you hear them say how much they love owls and you see a little owl figure and buy it for them , they will appreciate it .\nIt has been said that a man \u2019 s stomach is the way to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to it , everyone loves food !\nSo , if you want to show your love : fix your partner their favorite meal .\nMaking someone see they are a priority is the easiest way to show them you love them .\nSo , if you \u2019 ve been blowing your partner off to tend to work or whatever the case may be , it \u2019 s time to take the time to spend with them .\nEven if it \u2019 s for a few hours after work , set your phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your partner ( fully engaged . )\nSnuggling is one of the most intimate ways to show love .\nSo , the next time you want to show your partner you care , skip the s3x and go right to the post-s3x cuddles .\nNot only does it feel nice , but it also boosts oxytocin , the bonding hormone .\n6 .\nHelp them without them asking you to .\nActs of service don \u2019 t just mean cooking something or buying something for your partner .\nOn the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something help them .\nIf they are too short to reach something on the shelf , grab it .\nOr , if you notice they seem stressed , ask them how you can alleviate some of their stress .\nTrue and unconditional love includes accepting your partner for who they are .\nSometimes , we may not love certain things about our partner , or our partner may frustrate us , but ultimately , none of us are easy to be with .\n( I am not saying to accept your partner flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but if the worst thing they do is snore or leave their clothes on the floor , accept them and love them for who they are .\n8 .\nListen to them ( I mean really listen . )\nA lot of times , when the people we love are talking , we may have the intention of listening , but lose our focus .\nHowever , it \u2019 s important to really pay the people we love the attention .\nSo , if your partner is talking to you , focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get out of your head .\n9 .\nDo something romantic for them .\nA romantic gesture can be something so simple .\nPurchase them a rose .\nLight a candle at dinner .\nTake them on a picnic .\nThere are so many options .\nOne of the sweetest ways to show love is through dance .\nRegardless of whether it \u2019 s a slow and romantic dance or a fast-paced and fun dance .\nDance is a way to build energy and share a fun moment together .\n11 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ We often underestimate the importance of gratitude .\nOr , maybe we assume our partner just knows that we are grateful .\nBut , the thing is , people can not read your mind .\nSo , take the time to show or express to your partner what you appreciate most about them .\n12 .\nJoin in on their favorite hobby .\nMy husband has a hobby that I am not so much of a fan of .\nBut , from time to time , I join in with him and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change how I feel about it ( it \u2019 s really not my jam ) but more so because I know it makes him happy .\nAnd even though I really don \u2019 t prefer it- I know that I will still have a good time , because I am with him

Buddha and his journey towards enlightenment .\nWhen I heard it , I envisioned this profound and instantly understood transition that much take place when we were amid a spiritual awakening .\nHowever , as it turns out , spiritual awakening is much different than I ever envisioned it .\nFirst and foremost , awakening doesn \u2019 t happen overnight , or all at once .\nIt \u2019 s a gradual and neverending process , rather than a final destination .\nBut , those who are in the midst of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have never begun .\nAnd many of the signs of awakening are often misunderstood or even overlooked .\nBelow , I have listed the behaviors people don \u2019 t realize they portray because they are spiritually awake .\n1 .\nYou are becoming more conscious .\nConsciousness is awareness , and it \u2019 s becoming increasingly more difficult to stay conscious in the present moment .\nThat may sound odd , but distractions and escapes are all around us .\nNot only are they all around us , but to pull away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet is something that will get you some strange looks from friends and family .\nHowever , true consciousness and mindfulness of the present moment are so necessary .\n2 .\nYou can slow down and reflect .\nTaking time to slow down and reflect on the moment at hand is extremely important .\nA lot of people try to avoid reflection , but the more we move towards the process of spiritual growth and awakening , the more prone we become to taking the time for our personal growth .\n3 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ once would have caused an intense reaction .\nOne of the most profound moments of growth is when you don \u2019 t react to a situation that you once would have reacted to impulsively and in the wrong way .\nFor example , when someone says something offhanded- a knee-jerk reaction might be to start yelling at them or call them out .\nWhile that might make you feel good at the moment , it might also only add more negativity to the situation .\nBeing able to walk away is likely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning everything .\nA lot of times in life , we get so caught up in everything going on , that we forget to question things , and instead , blindly accept them .\nBut , when you break free of this pattern and begin to question things that you once would have accepted at face value , it is life-changing and a sign that you are awakening .\n5 .\nYou want to change the world .\nThose who are becoming spiritually awakened begin to realize how fundamentally flawed things are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they realize it- they want to do whatever they can to change it .\nSome people would avoid sitting with themselves at all costs .\nBeing alone is often thought of as one of the worst things that can happen .\nBut is it ?\nNo , not really .\nTime alone is beneficial for reflection , and critical thinking .\nIt \u2019 s necessary to allow us time to recoup .\nAnd once you get used to it or begin a spiritual journey , you will mind it less and less .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed into a little box .\nBut , when you begin shifting your awareness and thinking of things outside of that little box- a whole new world begins to open up to you .\nSpiritual awakening is much like this , and when we begin to awaken , our mind opens up .\nThose who are awakening give the best advice .\nA key difference is that those who are spiritually awakening don \u2019 t go around telling everyone how to lead their lives .\nThey wait to be asked and if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kindly give it .\nA typical day-to-day life with little meaning might be okay for a while , but once you cross over towards an awakened life , you will begin to want more .\nThis journey to find more , to be more , and to become more will become your new pursuit upon embarking on a spiritual journey .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/9-behaviors-people-dont-realize-they-portray-because-theyre-spiritually-awake/", "published": "Fri, 13 May 2022 02:42:33 +0000",

wager that there are two types of toxic parents : those who are toxic to their core as human beings , and those who unintentionally develop toxic traits .\nMost of us , as humans , have a tendency to fall into toxic patterns , but when you are in charge of raising a tiny human , it \u2019 s best to stay on top of those tendencies .\nIf I asked you what a toxic parent is , what would your response be ?\nAccording to therapist Susan Forward , a toxic parent is a parent who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , self-respect , confidence , appearance , and intelligence.\n\u201d Oftentimes , when we think of abuse , we think in terms of beating or other forms of physical abuse .\nBut , emotional abuse is just as detrimental if not more so , in many ways .\nToxic parenting goes deeper than the obvious , so be mindful that you don \u2019 t slip into a cycle of toxic parenting without realizing it .\nHere are 8 signs .\n1 .\nYou don \u2019 t allow your child to have their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own free will , beliefs and thoughts .\nWhile you may want them to agree with you , it \u2019 s better to not force their beliefs and opinions .\nFirstly , you can not change how someone thinks or feels .\nAnd secondly , to demand that they only agree with you and never think for themselves is control and manipulation , which is flat-out toxic .\n2 .\nYou control your child \u2019 s every move .\nI think some parents control their children because they want the best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t make it any better .\nWhile it \u2019 s one thing to tell your child what to do , you can not hover over them , or refuse to give them any power over their bodies or their lives .\n3 .\nYou compare your child to other children .\nComparing your child to another child may seem innocent enough .\nHowever , it \u2019 s a sure-fire way to send a very destructive message : you are not good enough .\nAnd kids internalize messages like that .\n4 .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic parents will live out their unrequited dreams through their kids .\nFor example , someone who always wanted to be a laywer or doctor may force their child to go into law school or medical school , rather than allowing them to develop their own goals and aspirations .\n5 .\nYou make toxic jokes about their appearance .\nIt may seem like you are only joking , but there again , kids who are in their developing stages take things very personally .\nAnd when you make a joke about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case may be , it can be extremely destructive to their well-being .\n6 .\nDuring arguments , you antagonize your child .\nAs parents , our job is to act like adults , not sink down to the level of a child .\nNo matter how upset you are during a fuss , or when you are getting onto them , you should NEVER taunt or antagonize your child .\n7 .\nInstead of providing validation- you mock your child \u2019 s emotions .\nKids depend on their parents for emotional support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them learn to cope with their emotions , and when we instead mock them and invalidate them , we are destroying their mental health .\n8 .\nThey refuse to ever admit fault .\nEveryone makes mistakes .\nHowever , being able to admit your wrong and do better makes a major difference .\nFor those parents who can never admit when they are wrong , this is a bad sign of a toxic parent .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

, it is typical for individuals to be interpersonally abusive , lack empathy , and be manipulative .\nNeedless to say , this combination of traits is not easy on the people that get close to them .\nEven scarier is the fact that many of them can put on a good face .\nThis is often known as masking , or even love-bombing because at the beginning of a relationship or friendship with a narcissist , they are quite good at pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with compliments , or pretend to be someone else entirely .\nBut , the more you get to know them , the more the mask begins to slip off .\nAnd if you are beginning to see the mask slip on your current partner , this can be alarming .\nHowever , certain signs can help you decipher whether this person is just a normal person with bad traits ( we \u2019

like they are only trying to win .\nIt \u2019 s much like having a constant debate , more so than it is having a conversation when you are communicating , and it can grow to be extremely exhausting .\n2 .\nYou never know who you are going to get when dealing with them .\nNarcissists can swing from one end of the spectrum ( speaking in terms of moods ) to the other , quite quickly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them often report walking on eggshells , because you never know what small detail will set them off into an angry rampage .\nNarcissists are classic conversation hogs .\nThey can not stand not being the center of attention , and if at any point they aren \u2019 t the center of attention , they will oftentimes demand it .\nThey are also known for interrupting others , or even talking over others .\nOne of the predominant traits of narcissism is manipulation .\nNarcissists can be extremely cunning and persuasive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely invasive to your boundaries .\n5 .\nThey cycle between idealization and devaluation .\nThere is a cycle present in toxic relationships with narcissists that swings from idealization to devaluation .\nOftentimes , narcissists will begin their relationships by idealizing their partners and making them feel as though they are being showered in love .\nThey are on their best behavior during this time .\nHowever , it isn \u2019 t long before the narcissist begins tearing them down and belittling them .\nBut , because no one will stick around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to idealization for a short period , before going back to bad behaviors .\nThis cycle is prevalent throughout the relationship until it is over .\n6 .\nThey are extremely jealous of everyone .\nNarcissists can be extremely jealous .\nIn many cases , when a narcissist sees someone else doing good , their first thought isn \u2019 t \u201c Good for them , they earned it.\n\u201d instead , their mind is saying , \u201c That \u2019 s not fair !\nI am the one who deserves that !\nNot them.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others .\nAnother trait to look out for in the narcissist is entitlement .\nThey believe the world owes them whatever they want- not because they have earned it , but

deeper , another picture unfolds and one that shows the roots beyond the behaviors .\nFor a long time in my life , I thought I was inherently flawed .\nI was weird and an outcast in many ways .\nAs I grew older , I began to notice that many of my quirks and odd behaviors seemed like signs of anxiety .\nHowever , when I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my anxiety was rooted in trauma .\nAccording to Psychology Today , \u201c the \u2018 trauma brain \u2019 wants to avoid any experience that reminds us of a time when we were unable to escape from discomfort.\n\u201d So , while certain behaviors may appear anxious-driven , it \u2019 s far more likely they are trauma responses if you have endured harsh traumas in your past .\n1 .\nPulling away when people get too close .\n( emotionally ) Oftentimes , when trauma occurs , it can cause the person affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also happen physically ( see below ) it frequently manifests on an emotional level .\n2 .\nRefusing to be vulnerable with others .\nThose who have been in a situation where their vulnerabilities were used as a weapon against them will end up forming a trauma response .\nMost often , this trauma response is forming a barrier between them and others , in which the vast majority of interactions they have with others are surface level .\nOnce you have been traumatized , you may fear everyone else .\nA common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust anyone.\n\u201d And while it makes sense to be apprehensive about people \u2013 trust is a necessary component of friendships and other relationships .\nWithout trust , it can be hard to form connections with others .\nOverindulging in the form of eating too much , drinking too much , shopping too much , or engaging in any activity over moderation can be a self-soothing mechanism .\nAnother aspect of this is avoiding food or substances , which is a form of control during times that feel chaotic or beyond control .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social gatherings altogether .\nFor them , people ( especially people they do not know ) can be scary and possibly even a source of uncontrollable angst .\n6 .\nMoving away from people when they get too close .\n( physically ) As I mentioned

had them pull back , it \u2019 s more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was that they don \u2019 t like you .\nPeople who have endured trauma constantly apologize .\nAnd if you say something about it , they will probably apologize for apologizing .\nSomewhere down the line , they have been made to feel like everything is their fault .\nTrauma survivors are easily startled .\nSudden movements , noises , and stimulation can cause them to jolt from fear .\nA lot of times , trauma survivors may misunderstand what is being said to them , or even perceive constructive criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may become defensive needlessly out of habit .\n10 .\nHaving a difficult time with situations beyond your control .\nAs a coping mechanism , survivors of trauma may feel that if they can completely control their

how drastically our parents and their tendencies impact us in the long term , it can no longer be questioned .\nBeing raised by a toxic parent can cause a lot of damage to their children .\nNow , with that being said , some children end up thriving despite their toxic raising .\nThat much is true .\nBut , it is not what is typical .\nThat isn \u2019 t to say that a child raised by a toxic parent can never overcome their raising .\nThey most definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t discount their struggle to get there .\nBecause our mothers and fathers ( we are speaking specifically today about toxic mothers , but have other articles on the site about toxic fathers as well ) model love and relationship skills for us in the way they show us and everyone else loves , when our mothers are toxic it can make things difficult for us in this area .\nHere are 8 behaviors of a toxic mother that often cause their children to have relationship problems later down the line .\n1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of boundaries .\nOur parents teach us boundaries , and when our parents don \u2019 t demonstrate healthy boundaries for us , we don \u2019 t learn them until we figure out how to teach ourselves or from a therapist .\nBecause of this , those raised by toxic parents may have a hard time establishing or even complying with boundaries .\nParents are supposed to teach healthy attachment by making their kids feel supported and secure in this world .\nWhen children don \u2019 t feel secure and loved by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as toddlers .\nResearchers observe this by seeing how children act when their parents return from being away .\nExamples of this are children who are clingy to their parents , never wanting them to move out of their sight , out of fear they may lose them again any time they leave .\nOr , some develop avoidant attachment , which means they push their parents away when they return to them .\nIn parent-child relationships where healthy attachments are developed are ones in which the child feels nurtured and loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones stable love , and in turn , their children often develop these unhealthy attachments .\nToxic mothers have a bad tendency to verbally assault their children , taunting them and even tearing them down .\nThis weighs on the psyche of a person as they grow up , and most especially when we are in our developmental stages .\nOftentimes , when toxic mothers speak harshly and unnecessarily cruelty to their kids , what happens is they internalize this and it destroys their self-esteem even into adulthood .\n4 .\nUnrealistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have unrealistic expectations of their partners .\nMany toxic mothers hold unrealistic expectations for their kids .\nNo matter what their kids do , it never seems like enough .\nIn turn , her children will hold unrealistic expectations of everyone else , including their partners .\nMuch of how we communicate is learned through our parents .\nWhen our parents communicate with us kindly , we too communicate with kindness .\nWhen our parents communicate clearly and efficiently , we can communicate clearly and efficiently .\nNow , imagine what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to poor communication .\nAnd because communication is so important in a relationship , you can see why this is so detrimental .\n6 .\nUntrustworthy behaviors lead to a lack of trust in others .\nWhen children are raised by an untrustworthy person , they grow to believe the world is an untrustworthy place .\nThey doubt everything and everyone , and in a relationship , trust is fundamental .\nEmotional support is mentioned twice because a lack of it can cause more than one problem down the line .\nWithout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our emotional intelligence to a certain degree .\nYes , we can develop this later in life , but it \u2019 s much harder than it would have been if our parents had demonstrated this .\nChildren who feel loved , and supported by their parents don \u2019 t typically engage in seeking validation outside of themselves , because they develop healthy self-esteem .\nConversely , when raised by a toxic parent , you are far more likely to need constant validation outside of yourself .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/8-behaviors-a-toxic-mother-displays-that-causes-her-child-to-have-relationship-problems/", "published":

bored with the same person .\nAs the spark begins to fade , the excitement they once felt from their partner feels lost .\nTo fill that void , they reach out and try to shake things up with someone

admitted to cheating and explained why .\nAccording to the analysis , self-esteem was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anger .\n3 .\nThey feel emotionally disconnected from their partner .\nIt \u2019 s a common misconception that cheating is all about sex .\nEspecially when it comes to females , cheating is in many cases an emotional affair ( quite literally . )\nWhen one or both partners are not getting their needs met within the relationship , they are far more likely to reach outside of it .\n4 .\nThey consider it revenge cheating .\nWhen one partner cheats and the other finds out , the chances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out ) cheating are exponentially increased .\nWhy ?\nBecause revenge is a great motivator .\n5 .\nThey are exploring themselves .\nPsychology Today cites self-exploration as a reason behind why some people cheat on those they love .\nWhen parts of ourselves are repressed , we tend to want to dig deeper .\nSome cheaters aren \u2019 t looking for a new partner , but are more so trying to discover things about themselves .\n6 .\nThey want the forbidden .\nThe appeal of the forbidden fruit can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even clich\u00e9 , but I am telling you , people want what they can not have .\nWhile not all people fall prey to this mindset , some do and end up cheating on their partners because of it .\n7 .\nThey are falling out of love .\nUnfortunately , when some people begin to fall out of love , rather than fixing the relationship they are in , they begin to seek new love out .\nWhile they may not have fallen entirely out of love , the fading of @ @ @ @ @ @

feeling the pressure of being a good parent and raising a child ready to face the world , it can be easy for us to become frustrated .\nif you are a parent , then you know exactly what I mean .\nIn the heat of the moment , you may feel like the weight and pressure of the world is on your shoulder .\nIn turn , without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something that you will end up regretting .\nUnfortunately , words have power .\nWhile it may be a simple mistake , the words you say when you are angry still stick with your child .\nI am by no means asserting that anyone is perfect .\nHowever , it \u2019 s best to avoid saying the following 10 things when you are disciplining your child .\n1 .\nStop crying or I \u2019 ll give you something to cry about .\nNot only is this statement cruel and callous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nKids need adults to help them work through their emotions .\nBut when you say something like this , you teach them to fear their emotions , and because of that , they will never learn how to cope with them healthily .\nInstead of saying this , say something like , \u201c I understand you are upset .\nI am too .\nAnd that \u2019 s okay .\nLet \u2019 s work through this together.\n\u201d 2 .\nI do everything for you !\nThis is another statement that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the fact of the matter is , that we shouldn \u2019 t be making our kids feel ashamed for existing .\nOf course , you do everything for them , because that is your job .\nWhen you say this , you are stressing your child out about something that is beyond their control .\nThis statement is rooted in a time in which people didn \u2019 t know very much about mental health and self-esteem or even emotional intelligence .\nFast-forward and research are showing that now , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids how to handle their emotions rather than shaming them with gender stereotypes .\nAs an example , if your little boy is crying and you say \u201c Boys don \u2019 t act that way , \u201d you are not only shaming a child for having emotions , which has nothing to do with their gender- but you are teaching them to be afraid to show how they feel .\nDuring a bad moment , you may very well be ashamed of how your child is acting .\nBut , when you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d you aren \u2019 t getting onto them for their behavior , you are generalizing their behavior to themself .\nIn turn , they don \u2019 t hear that you are upset with them for acting bad , they hear that everything about them is wrong .\n5 .\nDo I have to keep telling you the same thing ?\nWhen you continue to repeat yourself to your child , they learn that when you say something it doesn \u2019 t matter .\nInstead of continuing to repeat yourself or resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they refuse to listen .\n6 .\nBecause I said so .\nI remember growing up and hearing , \u201c It doesn \u2019 t matter because I SAID SO !\n\u201d And not to throw shade at my parents , they were doing the best they could base on what they knew .\nHowever , now people realize that saying this doesn \u2019 t teach your child anything .\nThe whole point of discipline is to teach , but when you say , \u201c because I said so !\n\u201d they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a clean space or not walk into traffic .\nThey only know that you told them to do so or not to do so .\nInstill a real-life lesson , and it \u2019 s far more likely to stick in their little brains .\nCan we just throw this phrase in the garbage for eternity ?\nJust because you were raised a certain way doesn \u2019 t mean it is right .\nPlenty of people were raised in HORRIBLE situations or by misguided parents who made HORRIBLE mistakes .\nLearn to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of parenting .\nWhile your child may be acting like their mother or their father when they act a certain way , it is best not to say this .\nThe reason being is that it \u2019 s not beneficial at all .\n9 .\nWhy can \u2019 t you be more like _______ ?\nYet another comparison game that should be terminated is comparing your child to another child .\nIt may be innocent enough ( at least your intentions ) but , when you say this , the message you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a developing child who internalizes everything : \u201c You aren \u2019 t good enough.\n\u201d And that \u2019 s devastating to their self-esteem .\nSometimes , kids act like monsters or troublemakers .\nBut , when you label them with an identity based on their behavior , it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy .\nNot to mention , it \u2019 s unfair .\nBecause we all act out of character from time to time .\nAddress the behavior , don \u2019 t label the child .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/10-things-you-should-never-say-when-disciplining-your-child/",

encourage him to do his best and to be his best .\n2 .\nTeach them to stand up for their beliefs .\nTeach him to stand up for what he believes is right while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sound counterintuitive ,

your son that family is important by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him .\nIt can not be said enough : if you want your son to grow into a good man , you need to demonstrate good behaviors and good values for him .\nChildren pay attention to our actions and behaviors far more than our words .\nSo , if you want to make a lasting impact you need to model the behavior you want from him .\n5 .\nHelp him to manage

with them .\nA lot of parents may mean well by doing everything for their children , but parenting experts agree , that it does far more harm than good .\nSo , even if you give your son a small list of chores each week , do it and stand by enforcing that they are done .\nDoing so will build discipline and teach him responsibility .\n7 .\nTeach him how to take responsibility for his actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work or chores .\nResponsibility is also taking ownership of your behaviors .\nTeach your son that it \u2019 s important to own his decisions , good or bad .\n8 .\nTeach him how to work hard .\nBeing a hard worker is a trait that many people value and for good reason .\nPeople who value hard work excel in many areas of their life because they passionately pursue the things they put their minds on .\n9 .\nAllow him to express his emotions .\nThere is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that boys don \u2019 t or shouldn \u2019 t cry .\nBoys and males in general , have emotions too .\nEmotions are not specific to gender .\nAnd teaching your child that their emotions are a source of shame is only going to end up making life much harder for them .\n10 .\nTeach him the value of respect .\nIt may seem obvious , but it needs to be said : respect is SO important .\nNot only is it important to teach your son to respect the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s also important to teach him about self-respect .\nI think a lot of people understand what respect means , but unless you instill the value of self-respect , respect will end up being a misunderstood concept to you .\nIf you teach your

this must be a good thing , right ?\nToo much love is never a bad thing , right ?\nWell , in the case of a narcissist ( or other toxic people ) everything is upside down .\nLet me clarify what I mean .\nNarcissists , sociopaths , psychopaths , and others who fall under the darker personas tend to fall into certain habits .\nOne of those habits is known as love-bombing .\nIt sounds harmless , but it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narcissist or another toxic person enters into a relationship , whether it be a romantic connection , a friendship , or a business partnership , they come on strong .\nThey

realize what is happening .\nThat \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important to know what the bait looks like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 9 signs to look out for .\nOne of the things to look out for if you think you are being love-bombed is someone who seems superficially charming .\nWhile some people are just nice and complimentary , when someone compliments you in a fake way over and over again , something is off .\nIf you are picking up on an off feeling associated with excessive comments , trust your gut .\n2 .\nThey want to spend every minute with you .\nToxic people have no sense of boundaries .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may seem endearing at first , but be sure to look out for other signs that something may be off .\n3 .\nThey call you their soulmate or only friend too quickly .\nThis is a MAJOR red flag

everything in common !\n\u201d blah , blah , blah , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being love-bombed .\nDo not fall into their trap and stand by your boundaries .\nLove-bombers move way too quickly .\nWithin the first few days of meeting someone , they will decide they are in love , want to get married , and are soulmates with someone .\nThere again , to someone who hasn \u2019 t had a lot of attention or to someone who does feel like there could be a real connection , this may feel endearing .\nBut , normal people don \u2019 t rush like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\n5 .\nThey bombard you with expensive gifts .\nLove-bombers will go out of their way to shower you with expensive gifts and will not accept no for an answer .\nGiving gifts doesn \u2019 t make someone a bad person , but if someone buys you expensive gifts and then tells you how much they cost or makes a huge deal out of it , they are likely love-bombing you .\n6 .\nThey try to be just like they think you want them to be .\nAnother thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMost people mirror people they like in small ways , but toxic people go way over the top .\nThey will change their entire style around the person they are trying to impress and will even go as far as to change their music tastes , food tastes , and more , to mold themselves into being who they feel their new interest wants them to be .\nThis is manipulation .\n7 .\nThey guilt-trip you for having boundaries .\nWhen you do assert boundaries , a love-bomber will make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don \u2019 t like me , then do you ?\n\u201d They might ask , after you tell them you need to spend time with family , after spending every day with them for the past two weeks that you \u2019 ve known them .\nThis is a major sign to look out for .\nNarcissists get obsessed very quickly .\nAfter just a short time of knowing you , they might begin to keep tabs on you or stalk you on social media .\nIf you go somewhere , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what you are doing .\nThis is a sign to RUN .\n9 .\nThey are getting overly involved in your life .\nIt might feel endearing to have someone take an interest in you .\nAnd when it \u2019 s done in a normal and healthy way , it is endearing .\nBut , if someone just met you two days ago , and they are already pushing themselves into the most personal aspects of your life , it \u2019 s a bad sign .", "author": "Harley Manson",

rewarding experience .\nBut , the rewards do not make the job easy .\nPerhaps the hardest part about being a parent is that oftentimes , even when we think we are doing the best possible thing , there

mental health , and that isn \u2019 t good for you or your child .\nSo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t walk away thinking that you are a failure .\nThe fact that you want to do better , grow , and understand where you could improve says everything you need to know about yourself as a parent : you are doing the best that you can .\nThe purpose of this article isn \u2019 t to shame you or make you feel even more pressure .\nIt \u2019 s to get you thinking about things from a new perspective so you can make the best possible choices as a parent .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 unintentional , but harmful parenting behaviors to stay mindful of .\n1 .\nTalking at your child instead of communicating with them .\nAccording to Barbara Greenberg , Ph.D. , \u201c Toxic parents are known for not listening to their kids , but instead , talking over them or at them , \u201d continuing , she explains , \u201c If parents recognize themselves doing this they should make a concerted effort to remain silent and listen , listen , and listen some more .\nIf kids feel listened to they will talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad habit that parents don \u2019 t always realize could be damaging is being overly critical .\nMany of us grew up with parents who had good intentions ( most of them anyway , I suppose a lot also had bad intentions ) and thought that criticizing us would make us \u201c tougher.\n\u201d Unfortunately , criticizing your child doesn \u2019 t make them tougher , it destroys their mental health .\nInstead of criticizing your child , if you notice a problem , talk to them like a human being .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset and because you are upset , take a moment for both of you to calm down and then re-approach them once the waves have settled .\nEmotional invalidation is very problematic for your child \u2019 s well-being , not only now , but into the future .\nBeing able to handle your emotions is key to being able to handle anxiety , being able to handle depression , processing anger and even expressing love .\nNeedless to say , emotional regulation is something that ripples into every facet of our life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say \u201c Stop acting like that , \u201d or \u201c It \u2019 s not that bad , \u201d or \u201c Why are you crying , you big baby ?\n\u201d you are invalidating their emotions .\nIn response , their first thought is that emotions must be bad , and avoided at all costs .\nAnd because emotions HAVE to be expressed , they will find other ways ( unhealthy ones ) to express them .\nIntimidation does not do anything beneficial for your child .\nWhen you intimidate your child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , teaching them you aren \u2019 t to be trusted , and instilling fear in them .\nIf you want to teach them , try communicating with them .\n5 .\nNot allowing your child to fail .\nIt may feel counterproductive to let your child fail .\nIt may even be uncomfortable to watch them .\nBut , failure is what will push them to figure out how to do something the right way on their own .\nWe learn from failure .\nWe discover how to stand on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow your child to fail .\nNot only is this a violation of your child \u2019 s boundaries , but it \u2019 s also a sure-fire way to make them extremely anxious and depressed .\nDo not discuss adult problems with your child , because they aren \u2019 t an adult .\nThe only thing this will do is put a massive weight on their shoulder that they are powerless to control .\n7 .\nDisciplining to punish , not to teach .\nIt \u2019 s a common misconception that discipline means punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to teach .\nAnd teaching can happen through communication , rewarding effort , consistency , and continued expression of expectations and consequences .\nWhen you are disciplining your child to punish them out of anger , you are doing it for the wrong reason .\nChildren are like sponges , they absorb everything we say to them and pick up on the words we use to describe their behavior .\nWhen you use labels like \u201c You are so lazy , \u201d they are going to fall into the behavior of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your word for it .\nBe careful with your words .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

parenting , a lot of the time , we think that as long as we aren \u2019 t doing something with bad intentions ( abuse ) to our kids , they will turn out fine .\nAnd while it \u2019 s good to approach parenting with the best intentions \u2013 you still have to be aware of the fact that no matter how well-intentioned you are , you could still be doing the wrong thing .\nDon \u2019 t get me wrong , I am not saying that you as a person or a parent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am saying is that as a species , there is always room for growth .\nEvery few years , we realize new insights about psychology , parenting , and various other aspects of human behavior that show us how we can change for the better .\nFor example , we are learning more and more about how beneficial it is to focus on emotional management for our development and socialization later in life .\nOnce upon a time , parents shunned their children for displaying emotions .\nNow , science is showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Approach parenting with an open mind .\nBe open to learning and change .\nAnd stay aware of yourself and your parenting habits .\nWith that in mind , here are 9 damaging parenting habits to look out for .\nShaming is one of those things that is passed down generationally .\nWe see our parents and hear our parents shaming us as we grow up , and perhaps there was a time in which they shamed us and the shaming caused us so much pain and guilt that we ended up listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , it benefited us .\nBut , those benefits do not come without a cost .\nShaming your child causes them unnecessary anxiety , plummets their self-esteem , and hurts them emotionally .\nYou don \u2019 t need to shame to teach , there are many other better ways .\nOur kids are born into this world with very few primal needs : the first is for us to love them , bond with them , and make them feel secure and safe ( through affection ) and the other is food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but when it comes down to it , these are the primary needs . )\nWhen you withhold affection , your child \u2019 s first thought is that there is something inherently wrong with them on a fundamental level .\nYour intention might be to teach them something , but the only thing you are teaching them is that love is conditional , and it should not be , Children need limits .\nWhen you allow your child to do whatever they want and have no rules , no structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are setting them up for failure in life .\nNot only will they not function in a world that is full of limits , but they will also end up extremely dependent on you .\nAnd I hate to say it , but there will be a day when you are not around and when that day comes , your child will be helpless .\nTeach them limits now , to prepare them to survive without you .\nParenting is the only job that you want to work your way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that one day they won \u2019 t need you anymore .\nThis is yet another generational thing that I honestly hope goes away with new parents who learn to break generational curses .\nIt \u2019 s not healthy for your child to be afraid of you .\nNot only does it break their bond with you , thus making them fearful of others , but intimidation also doesn \u2019 t teach .\nIt only shows them that they should be fearful and careful of YOU and others , if your intention is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are always going to come up dry or teach them the wrong lesson with this habit .\n5 .\nNot allowing your child to make mistakes .\nMistakes are part of life .\nWhen we make mistakes , we learn how to overcome hurdles and struggles , and we get better and better .\nFailure is a state of mind , and if you want your child to have a growth mindset , they need to be able to make mistakes .\nIt might be hard to watch them fail sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them every time , they will never be able to survive without you .\nOr , it \u2019 s going to be difficult .\nThis one may sound odd .\nBut hear me out .\nIt \u2019 s okay to tell your child how amazing they are or tell them how much you love them or praise them for good behavior .\nIt \u2019 s okay to compliment your kids , but make it mean something .\nIf you compliment every move they make , they will begin to lose their value .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on others for validation .\n7 .\nExpecting them to be perfect .\nNo one is perfect .\nNo one .\nAnd when you expect perfection from your child , you are going to end up disappointed , and not only that , you are going to destroy their sense of self .\nEach time your child doesn \u2019 t meet your expectations , and you push them to do more or express that you are disappointed , they are going to internalize that .\nIn turn , they are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be good enough .\nIt \u2019 s okay to encourage your child to be the best version of themselves that they can be .\nBut don \u2019 t hold them to unreachable standards .\n8 .\nDo as I say , not as I do mentality .\nA lot of parents say \u201c Do as I say , not as I do , \u201d with their kids .\nBut , the thing is , reality doesn \u2019 t work like that .\nYour kids are going to follow your lead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more than your words .\nWhen you are constantly comparing your child to others , or criticizing them , you are telling them that they are not enough .\nThat might not be what you are saying verbatum , but what they hear is that they aren \u2019 t up to your standards .\nYou might not realize it , but that is extremely damaging .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

Disney .\nFor the rest of us , love is built .\nIt takes time .\nIt takes effort .\nThere will be struggles and honestly , you aren \u2019 t going to always like the person you are with .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion with these relationship-destroying habits , then you are going to end up completely tanking the relationship .\nAnd this goes for both sides .\nIf you are doing a great job , but your partner isn \u2019 t doing the work and instead is participating in relationship destroying habits , then guess what ?\nUnfortunately , it isn \u2019 t likely things are going to work out .\nIf these behaviors are present in your relationship , it may be time to make a change .\nA lot of people mistake obsession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the same .\nLove comes from an authentic place .\nIt \u2019 s acceptance , it \u2019 s understanding , and it is respect .\nObsession is insecurity , distrust , and co-dependence .\nIf someone wants to be with you every second of every day and gets upset because you need space and time to yourself , this does not love , it is an obsession .\nAnd obsession is a destroyer of relationships .\nIn the same vein as obsession , jealousy is a toxic relationship habit .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to have trust .\nWithout trust , a relationship is doomed to failure .\nExamples of jealousy are if you talk to a male friend and your boyfriend accuses you of cheating , or if your girlfriend sees you smile at the waitress as she takes the menu , and she immediately jumps to the conclusion that you must be sleeping with her .\nBe wary of behaviors like this .\n3 .\nFighting to win , not fighting to save the relationship .\nAnother misconception I think a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeing with your partner when an argument begins , that the point of the argument is to prove you are right .\nIf you are fighting to prove you are right , you aren \u2019 t fighting for the relationship .\nThis is where the whole \u2018 choose your battles , \u2019 mentality comes into play .\n4 .\nTreating one another with contempt .\nIf you ask the majority of relationship counselors , they are going to tell you that there is one behavior that stands out above the rest : contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in love only meet each other with anger , resentment , and bad energy , the relationship is not going to last .\nLet me be clear , I think it \u2019 s important for two people to have their own identity and life outside of the relationship .\nHowever , when you never spend time with your partner and leave them out of everything , you are going down a bad road .\nRemember : balance is key .\nTriangulation is often brought up when speaking in terms of narcissistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangulation occurs in many relationships , not just narcissistic ones .\nTriangulation , put simply is when you bring another person into your relationship problems .\nHere \u2019 s an example .\nYou and your partner are fighting .\nThey don \u2019 t see where they are wrong .\nTo prove that you are right , you call up your partner \u2019 s mom and explain what has happened .\nYour partner \u2019 s mom calls up your partner and asks her what her problem is .\nThis only ends up making your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems are family news .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/6-common-behaviors-that-destroy-relationships-2/", "published": "Thu, 09

partner no longer loves them .\nUnfortunately , though , in some relationships , this does happen .\nIt \u2019 s a very sad fact .\nWhat \u2019 s even sadder , is that love can blind us to painful truths , in many cases , we may refuse to acknowledge the truth .\nHowever , your gut does not lie to you .\nWhen a gnawing , painful knot begins to grow in your stomach telling you that something is amiss , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you may want to , because who wants to think , \u201c My partner doesn \u2019 t love me anymore , \u201d but the longer you prolong having an authentic talk and

feels like enough .\nNo matter what you do , it never feels like it \u2019 s good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have done differently or something about you that needs to be changed .\nIt \u2019 s like they want you to be someone else entirely .\n2 .\nThere is no communication .\nCommunication is complete upside down .\nEither you don \u2019 t communicate at all , or when you do communicate , it \u2019 s with contempt or anger .\nReal , authentic communication has gone out the window .\n3 .\nThere are no arguments .\nMost people assume that when you argue , it \u2019 s a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , healthy relationships involve an argument from time to time .\nWhat \u2019 s much scarier than having a big argument is when one or both of you stop caring enough to even fight for the relationship .\n4 .\nThere is no passion .\nWhen you go to hug them , they seem to like their heart isn \u2019 t in it .\nWhen you look in their eyes , they look away .\nAnd when you have sex , it doesn \u2019 t feel like an act of intimacy , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you begin to notice these signs , it shows that they are emotionally withdrawing .\n5 .\nThey pick fights and try to break up with you .\nEvery little disagreement turns into a massive fight , following a break-up , or their attempt to break up with you .\nAnd for some reason , you may have an itching feeling that the reason they are picking fights with you is that they don \u2019 t want to do this anymore .\n6 .\nThey pull away from affection .\nWhen you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to them , they pull away .\nYou may begin to feel completely neglected ( on an affectionate level ) because there is no affectionate touch in the relationship anymore .\nUnfortunately , this is a sign that their heart is no longer in it anymore .\nSmall things matter .\nIf you notice your partner is no longer doing the little things , is forgetting things that are important to you , and blowing you off all the time , it \u2019 s a bad sign .\nAll relationships dwindle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when your partner stops cherishing you entirely , something is wrong .\nPay attention to how your partner talks to you .\nWhen you say \u201c I love you , \u201d and they say , \u201c okay , \u201d instead of \u201c I love you too , \u201d and this happens all the time , it \u2019 s a bad sign .\nAnother thing to look out for is if you bring up the future , and they change the subject .\n9 .\nThey don \u2019 t consider your feelings .\nYour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely .\nWhen you say how something makes you feel , they roll their eyes or change the subject .\nThey make plans without asking what you think or do things that completely violate your boundaries .\n10 .\nThey compare you to others .\nWhen your partner begins to compare you to someone else ( another potential partner ) and says things like , \u201c Wow , he looks great !\nWhy can \u2019 t you be more like him ?\n\u201d or \u201c Wow , look at how she looks .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or compares you in any way to

people who are upset or hurt by their partners or family .\nBut , despite the popularity of the phrase , I feel like a lot of people don \u2019 t understand what gaslighting is .\nSo , to clear things up , I have collected some information from credible sources to provide you with everything you need to know about gaslighting .\nIf , after reading this , you have discerned that you are being gaslit , you should take some time to decide how to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s probably time to reassess the relationship in which you are being gaslit , or draw up some serious boundaries .\nWith all of that being said , here are the 8 things you need to know about gaslighting .\nGaslighting is extreme emotional abuse .\nHonestly , when you think about it , it \u2019 s mental torture .\nAnd anyone who will gaslight you regularly is someone that you do not need to be around .\nThey are manipulative , and manipulative people can be emotionally and physically dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to make you question your sanity .\nGaslighters have one main goal : they want to make you question your sanity .\nIf you question your sanity , they can control you .\nFor example , a mother-in-law who wants to take control of their grandchild \u2019 s life may say , \u201c You are an unfit parent , \u201d when you get upset and say , \u201c What did you just say to me ?\n\u201d the gaslighter will likely say , \u201c I didn \u2019 t say anything .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby would be better off with me.\n\u201d Other examples are abusive partners claiming the abuse never happened or that the victim hit them first .\n3 .\nThe second goal of gaslighting is to make others question your sanity .\nThe thing about gaslighters is they are manipulative .\nAnd in many cases , they are playing the big game not just the small one .\nWhat I mean by this , is that the gaslighter will work slowly over time to make you doubt yourself and to make others doubt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how \u201c crazy \u201d you are , or how \u201c sensitive \u201d you are to yourself and others .\nThey will continuously build up , telling stories and lies to your friends and your family as well .\nThey want to make you look crazy , so they can do with you as they please .\nAfter prolonged gaslighting , you can end up losing your sanity .\nThe thing is , when you are made to not believe or trust your sense of perception , you will not trust or believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can end up making you lose track of what is real and what isn \u2019 t .\n5 .\nNot all people who gaslight are narcissists .\nJust because someone gaslights you , does not mean they are a narcissist .\nYes , narcissists do gaslight , and it \u2019 s a common thing for a narcissist to do so .\nBut , there are various types of individuals who engage in manipulative behaviors , not just narcissists .\n6 .\nThe phrase gaslighting was coined in 1938 .\nThe term narcissist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called \u201c gas light \u201d was shown .\nIn the play , which was later made into a movie , a woman \u2019 s husband slowly manipulates her into believing she is insane .\n7 .\nJust because someone disagrees with you doesn \u2019 t mean they are gaslighting you .\nMuch like any buzzword , the term gaslight gets thrown around a lot and is misused .\nI often see people on social media saying , \u201c That \u2019 s gaslighting !\n\u201d when someone just simply disagreed with them .\nJust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t mean they are gaslighting you .\n8 .\nGaslighting can occur in relationships of all forms , not just romantic .\nYou do not have to be romantically involved with someone for them to gaslight you .\nPoliticians do it , doctors do it , a mother-in-law does it , your parents can do it and your friends can too .\nAnyone who has an interest in manipulating you can gaslight you .\nNow , that isn \u2019 t to say that everyone will .\nIt \u2019 s not a common @ @ @ @ @", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

Photos of Your Children on Social Media", "content": "As someone who grew up in pre-social media , it \u2019 s easy to look back on a time when people didn \u2019 t share every single thing with the internet .\nFast-forward to modern times , and if you don \u2019 t share everything about your life , people think you are weird .\nAnd while there is nothing wrong with sharing things with your friends and family on social media , there should most definitely be boundaries .\nFor example , you wouldn \u2019 t ( or shouldn \u2019 t , I don \u2019 t know your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media .\nThere

their child starts using the potty , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought might be , \u201c Oh , let me share this moment with my social media followers.\n\u201d However , that is not a good idea , not only because there are weirdos in the world , but also because one day your child might be embarrassed about it , or even bullied for it .\n2 .\nPhotos that hold private information about your children .\nWhen posting photos , be careful not to share images that give details as to where they go to school , your full address , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound paranoid , but anyone can take those details and use them with the wrong intentions .\nEven if you know every one of your followers , there is always a chance that they can be hacked by a predator .\nOver the years , there have been a lot of viral posts of kids holding a sign about how their mom sold their PlayStation because they didn \u2019 t clean their room , or making their child stand in the rain because they were disrespectful .\nI could name a dozen instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids .\nThe thing is , despite the trendy nature of this type of posting , it \u2019 s HORRIBLE to do to your child .\nShaming destroys self-esteem , and honestly when you think of it , it \u2019 s pretty toxic to publically shame/humiliate your child on social media .\nYou might not have a problem with posting your child \u2019 s photos online .\nBut , before you go posting group photos of every child in your child \u2019 s class or on your child \u2019 s team , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too .\nPhotos of your child crying , holding a stuffed animal , or captioned with a silly nickname only you use for them could later be perceived as humiliating .\nAnd the thing about the internet is , once something is out there , it \u2019 s out there for good .\nDon \u2019 t share something your child could one day be bullied for .\nWhen I was a kid , it was all the rage for parents to put unlit cigarettes in their kid \u2019 s mouths and take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social media was not a thing back then .\nUnfortunately , this is still trendy for some , to take a picture of their toddler with a beer bottle and then post the picture on social media .\nOr , to be holding their child in their lap , while moving their car in their driveway \u2013 while simultaneously holding their smartphone to capture the moment .\nAny activity that can jeopardize your child \u2019 s safety should not be a photo op .\n7 .\nWhen they are undressed .\nHonestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , I will say it anyway , don \u2019 t post naked pictures of your kids online .\nNot only is this going to be embarrassing to them later on , but it \u2019 s also just not a good idea .\nThere again , there are unsavory people on the internet , and no matter how well you think you know your followers , there is always the risk of someone hacking into a friend or follower \u2019 s account .\nJust save these for close family and in-person showing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured .\nAs parents , our job is to protect our children .\nEspecially when they are vulnerable .\nPosting their images when they are in their most vulnerable state when they don \u2019 t look or

"content": "In a perfect world , no child would ever be abused or neglected .\nUnfortunately , though , we do not live in a perfect world .\nOne of the most heart-breaking situations in the world is when you realize that a child is being abused or neglected .\nNot only is it heart-breaking , but it can be a difficult situation to navigate .\nIf you are sensing that a child that is in your life is being neglected or abused , and you want to be sure , I have listed the signs below .\nWhile most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as abuse , it is very much abuse .\nAnd the sooner the neglect is stopped , the better chance the child has of overcoming it .\nI will also add some information about reporting the abuse after the signs .\nA child who is being neglected will wear clothes that do not fit properly or that are tattered and have holes in them .\nYou may notice their shoes don \u2019 t fit properly .\nAnd you may notice that their shoes and clothes aren \u2019 t appropriate for the weather .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPay attention to how the child acts .\nIf they seem desperate for attention and cling to any adult that will pay them attention , this may be a sign that they are being neglected .\nAlone , this sign could mean many things , but in combination with other signs and a gut feeling \u2013 listen to it .\n3 .\nThe child has mentioned a lack of adult supervision .\nYou have heard the child say that they lack adult supervision at home .\nThey claim they are left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense because they seem to be able to do whatever they want .\n4 .\nThe parent shows little concern for the child .\nWhen you have seen the parent , they show very little regard for the child .\nFor example , if you are a teacher , and you have told them that they are struggling in school and they simply don \u2019 t care , or you bring up that you noticed their clothes don \u2019 t fit right they brush it off , something is wrong .\n5 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ care .\nIf a child is enrolled in school and is constantly missing days because their parent forgets to bring them , or isn \u2019 t present at all , this is a sign of neglect .\nA missing day from time to time is one thing , but when they are flunking out because no one is taking them , this is a bad sign .\n6 .\nThey are behind on medical care ( severely . )\nPay attention to things like medical care going unprovided .\nSome neglected children may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no glasses .\nThey may have cuts/scrapes that have not been cleaned and bandaged .\nNeglected children don \u2019 t always get the proper nutrition at home .\nIn turn , when they are around anyone that might feed them , they will beg for food .\nOther signs will be them showing signs of malnutrition , either being underweight or having discoloration in their skin .\nWhile some kids just don \u2019 t like baths , if you notice that their clothes are dirty , they haven \u2019 t taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes are ill-fitting this could most definitely be a combination that shows neglect .\n9 .\nThey claim to be abused or neglected .\nListen to a child that claims they are being abused .\nIf they are telling you that something is wrong , and you brush it off and ignore them , you are failing them .\nYes , they might not be telling the truth , but it \u2019 s far more likely that they are than it is that they are lying .\nReport their claims immediately to someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay attention to is behavior changes .\nAn abused or neglected child will have drastic behavior changes .\nThey might completely quit caring about school , stop showing up for school , become aggressive , or become clingy out of nowhere .\nThese shifts need to be noted .\nWhen a child has a failure to thrive , it means that they are not at the right weight/ height , and they are struggling in comparison to another child .\nA failure to thrive is based on pediatric age and is caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Developmental lags are when a child is missing major milestones .\nFor example , if you notice a 5-year-old who is still using the bathroom on themselves because they haven \u2019 t been properly potty-trained , this is a sign of neglect .\nOr a

Dangerous", "content": "Narcissists are individuals who have a narcissistic personality disorder .\nBecause there are so many symptoms of narcissism , a narcissist can manifest in many different forms .\nWhile there are many harmless narcissists , there are also extremely dangerous ones .\nIt honestly depends on who you are dealing with , and how their personality is manifesting .\nFor a long time in my life , before I understood much about the depths of mental health , I thought that only psychopaths/sociopaths could be dangerous and that narcissists were not .\nIn reality , not all psychopaths or sociopaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be .\nWith all of that being said , no matter what , if you meet someone who has a lack of empathy , is obsessed with themselves , is manipulative , and who will step over anyone who gets in their way , it \u2019 s best to keep them at a distance .\nJust because someone may not be physically dangerous , does not mean they can not destroy your life .\nJust a thought .\nAnyways , here are 6 reasons why narcissists are so dangerous .\n1 .\n437 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression among narcissists .\nInverse reviewed 437 studies of narcissism and found a 21 % increase in aggression and an 18 % increase in violence among narcissists in comparison to others .\nAggression is defined as any behavior that causes harm to another that does not consent to be harmed .\nAnd violence is an act of aggression that involves extreme physical harm .\n2 .\nThey often put the lives of others in danger if it suits them .\nNarcissists put their needs above others and oftentimes , at a cost .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , they will put you in danger to get it .\n3 .\nThey have low levels of empathy .\nOne of the defining traits of narcissism is a lack of empathy .\nEmpathy is our ability to understand the emotions of others and put ourselves in someone else \u2019 s place .\nA narcissist has low levels of empathy and doesn \u2019 t always think about how their actions will affect another .\nEven if they do , if their needs come first , then empathy is out the window .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t anything going on in their lives , they get bored .\nAnd when a narcissist gets bored , they love to stir the pot .\nThey tend to start major fights with people for no reason .\nAnd they like to say controversial things to people they know it will offend , just to get a rise out of them .\nThis can be dangerous , because if you stir the wrong pot , you may end up in trouble .\n5 .\nTheir entitlement often supersedes the well-being of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever they want .\nIf they want something , they will do what it takes to get it .\nIn some cases , they will lie , cheat , steal or even murder someone to get what they want .\nIn Psychology Today , Claire Jack , Ph.D. , explains that narcissists can be dangerous because they do not respect experts .\nAn example she gives is about a patient she has that is a doctor .\nThe doctor had a patient who had a daughter who had no respect for the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all hours , being rude , expressing anger , and advising her father to go against the doctor \u2019 s wishes .", "author":

mental health , \u201d Janet Brito LCSW , AASECT certified sex therapist explains .\nBut , sex is still a very intense topic and there are many layers and facets to the discussion .\nBelow , I am going to list 7 ways sex impacts our mental health , for the good and the bad .\nAs you may know by now , serotonin is a happy hormone that controls and balances moods .\nWhen our serotonin is low , our mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated place .\nWhen it \u2019 s balanced , we feel motivated and happy .\nSex boosts our serotonin , helping us to alleviate depression .\nIf you \u2019 ve ever had really good sex , then you know what I mean .\nSex helps improve sleep , because our body releases prolactin and oxytocin during sex , both of which help us to sleep more restfully .\nWithout proper rest , our mental health suffers , so if sex helps you to get good rest , it \u2019 s going to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone you feel a connection to can make you feel great , a casual hook-up can plummet your self-esteem .\nDespite being surrounded with messages in the media , movies , etc that casual sex is okay , researchers have shown time and time again that people encounter low self-esteem , embarrassment and guilt after a casual hookup .\nDid you know that erectile dysfunction and anxiety go hand in hand ?\nJoe Kort , a sex therapist says that more and more younger men are coming in with ED because they feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to perform .\nThen , because the anxiety makes it harder for them to perform , they become even more anxious .\nIt \u2019 s a vicious cycle .\nWomen also are less likely to enjoy sex if they are anxious .\nThe good news , though , is that if you can put your fears away for a moment and just get into it , sex eases anxiety .\nThe reason sex eases stress and anxiety is that it releases dopamine , endorphins , and oxytocin .\nAll of which help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major role in how two people get along with one another in a relationship .\nSometimes , when the sex is thrown off , and it happens less frequently , partners feel resentful towards one another .\nThe longer they go without sex , the less they want it .\nBut , the kicker here is , that when you begin to have sex more , you feel more connected and it bridges the gap .\n7 .\nIt makes you look & feel younger .\nAccording to a study , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five to seven years younger than they are .\nAnd through looking younger , they have increased confidence , happiness , and enthusiasm about life .\nSo , if you are feeling like your youth is slipping away , have some sex .", "author":

, there are most definitely signs that assure us that a relationship will last forever .\nThe reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship to last lies within our habits .\nAnd not just the habits of one partner , but the combined habits of both .\nWith that being said , here are 12 signs a couple will stay in love forever .\nOpen communication and transparency are extremely important for a relationship to work .\nCouples who stay together stay honest with one another .\nIf something doesn \u2019 t feel right , they express what is going on in their mind .\nIf they are considering a big purchase , they let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harboring secrets from one another , those secrets only end up dividing them and tearing them apart .\nQuality time is so important .\nAnd not just time together , where you both stare into space or at your phones , but real quality time .\nNot only does spending quality time establish a bond between the partners , but it also makes communication , trust , and intimacy possible .\nAnd while quality time is important , it \u2019 s also important for the two individuals who are in the relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as well .\nSpace is important and time apart is important .\nWhen you lose sight of who you are , because of the relationship , you stop being the person your partner fell in love with .\nThe makings of a good relationship include two people who are teammates .\nThey work together to be a team and support and love each other no matter what .\nThey aren \u2019 t fighting against one another , it \u2019 s them against the world .\n5 .\nThey genuinely respect one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible in a relationship .\nTwo people who respect one another can grow together and thrive together .\nCompromise is the ability to put your desires to the side , to give a little bit , to find common ground .\nIt \u2019 s saying that it \u2019 s okay that you don \u2019 t have to get exactly what you want if it means that you and your partner can find a way that works for both of you .\nAnd compromise is the middle ground that bridges the disagreement gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fight for the relationship , not their ego .\nA sure sign of a couple that is going to stay together is a couple that fights the right way .\nYou might be shaking your head because you likely believe that a couple who argues is a couple that is doomed for failure .\nThe fact is , though , no two people can be together without disagreeing .\nIt just isn \u2019 t possible .\nBut , if you can navigate through that disagreement , say your piece , hear theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of fighting against them to \u2018 win \u2019 you are in a healthy relationship .\n8 .\nThey support each other .\nIt \u2019 s so important to support your partner .\nWhen they decide they want to pursue their dreams , if you say , \u201c That \u2019 s such a dumb idea , you will never be able to do that !\n\u201d you are showing them that you have no trust .\nYou have to be the catalyst for them to do what no one else believes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple who has been together for years , you are likely going to find a couple that is accepting of one another .\nIn the beginning , we are so in love , so infatuated and so under the influence of the spark of passion that we overlook each other \u2019 s flaws .\nThen , as the spark dies down and life becomes normal , those flaws can start to get to each of you .\nFor a bit , there is a struggle , but because you love each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or leave each other .\nOr you can despise one another , and that isn \u2019 t a recipe for a long-term commitment .\nSo , couples who learn to accept each other are far more likely to stay together .\n10 .\nThey are best friends .\nIt \u2019 s so important to establish a friendship with your partner , before anything else .\nBecause when the spark does die down from time to time , there needs to be something real that holds the two of you together .\nAnd friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can make each other laugh .\nIf you ask most people who are single what they look for in a partner , they are going to say , \u201c Someone who can make

can read each other \u2019 s thoughts .\nSomething happens when two people are on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I and my husband who have been together for a long time can seriously finish each other

differently in a way that is beneficial and treating them differently in a way that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s earliest years , it is so important for us to help them establish their boundaries and to respect the healthy boundaries they have .\nLater in life , if this is done , they are far more able to establish boundaries with their partners and friends .\nBecause children don \u2019 t come with guidebooks , sometimes we do things that are unintentionally harmful to them .\nAnd the more knowledge we have , the better able we are to raise them .\nHere are 9 ways parents unintentionally violate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when a parent is constantly hovering over their child , never allowing them space or empowerment over any aspect of their lives or themselves .\nOftentimes , when parents are constantly hovering over their children , they are correcting their every move and preventing them from doing anything independently .\nNot only is this an invasion of

difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while it may not seem like a big deal to us- it feels like a big deal to them .\nThe worst thing you can do when your child is crying is called them a baby or say something condescending or shame them in any way for a negative display of emotion .\n3 .\nSpeaking negatively about their other parent .\nAnother overstep that parents often make is to speak ill of the other parent .\nExamples of this can be a parent that is divorcing another who constantly makes remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even couples that are still together can do this without thinking much of it .\nRegardless \u2013 children love both parents , and they don \u2019 t need to be brought into whatever problems are between the two of you .\nIt \u2019 s nice to get hugs from your child and give them hugs- but affection should not be a requirement .\nSometimes , they simply won \u2019 t feel like hugging you , and that is okay .\nWhat is not okay is to shame them for having this boundary .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable or scary to them .\nWhen I was growing up , I had friends who had parents who forced them to join softball , baseball , or football teams , even after the child had already participated in said activities and decided it wasn \u2019 t for them .\nRather than respecting their boundary \u2013 their parents would continue to force them into things they had no interest in .\nOther examples of this include when your child is scared of a new experience \u2013 perhaps they don \u2019 t want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you continue to try to push them to do it .\nThis is a major invasion of boundaries .\n6 .\nDiscussing your private life with them .\nThere is a fine line between adult talk and child talk- and the going on of a parent \u2019 s personal life is adult talk .\nChildren don \u2019 t need to know about their parent \u2019 s love life or sex life , or squabbles between their parents and their friends .\n7 .\nSaying harsh words about yourself in front of @ @

pollution and plastic pollution and penis shrinkage/ fertility problems among the human population .\nDr. Andrew Pask and Dr. Mark Green from the University of Melbourne said in Australia , penis birth defects have doubled in recent years , due to plastic pollution .\nTo demonstrate this , the scientists explored how exposure to chemicals impacted both humans and animals .\nOne thing they were trying to understand was the birth defect known as hypospadias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penis to develop in a way that impairs function .\nWhat they found was a strong link between plastic-based chemicals and penis defects .\nIn a 2014 study carried out by the Department of Health Sciences , Karlstad University , Sweden , they explored the effects of Phthalates , which are a common component of many products .\nIn the study , they found a significant shortening between the penis and the anus .\n\u201c These findings call into question the safety , \u201d the report reads .\n\u201c Particularly because a shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the genitals ) has been shown to relate to male genital birth defects in children and impaired reproductive function in adult males and the fact that human levels of

our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that can be beneficial .\nHere are 6 gaslighting phrases abusive parents use .\n1 .\nThat isn \u2019 t what happened , you are being too sensitive .\nWhen you recall something that happened that your parent doesn \u2019 t want you repeating , they will rebut it with a phrase like this .\nTo them , it \u2019 s outrageous that you would be emotionally hurt or offended at how they have treated you poorly in the past .\nAnd to downplay what has happened , they will call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know what you like , here let me see that .\nA gaslighting parent wants you to feel dependent on them .\nWhen they see you taking control over your life and making choices of their own , they are likely to try to step in .\nOne way in which they can do this is to make you feel like you don \u2019 t know what you want or how you feel .\nYou need them to do that for you .\n3 .\nYou must have dreamed it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they completely refuse to acknowledge it .\nInstead , they will flat out say it didn \u2019 t and that you must have made it up or dreamed it up .\n4 .\nThere you go again , making things up .\nIn the same vein as \u2018 you must have dreamed it , \u2019 accusing you of making things up makes you appear to be crazy or like a liar .\nWhen your credibility is diminished , you are far easier to control .\n5 .\nDon \u2019 t be silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very disheartening to try to bring something up , in hopes that they will recognize it and take responsibility for it , only to be shut down .\n\u201c That never happened , don \u2019 t be silly , \u201d is a double whammy , because not only are they denying it outright , but they are also saying you are silly for even saying it out loud .\n6 .\nNow , why did you make me do that ?\nPerhaps the biggest gaslight is when someone makes you feel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior .\nAn abusive parent may blame you for them losing control and abusing you .\nIf you even so much as looked at them incorrectly , you are to blame for them abusing you .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/6-gaslighting-phrases-abusive-parents-use-to-control-you/", "published": "Wed, 22 Jun 2022 02:34:13

time , I didn \u2019 t think much of this phrase , but now it makes more and more sense the older that I get .\nFor example , it \u2019 s easy to get lost doing something you enjoy .\nIf you enjoy shopping , you could probably spend hours of your day shopping and would never lose focus .\nOn the other hand , if you needed to study for a test to complete a certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that it was not only hard to motivate yourself to study but that it was also hard to stay focused .\nWhy is that ?\nThe answer lies within the reward center of the brain .\nWhen we do something that we anticipate will be a good experience , even thinking of the activity will give us great pleasure .\nDopamine , the pleasure hormone in the brain is responsible for this .\nWe not only get a dopamine hit while we do a pleasurable activity , but we also get one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the activity .\nThis is why if you enjoy something , the thought of it will push you to do the activity .\nThe problem with this is that while it would be nice to never have to do something we don \u2019 t enjoy , we would also not even grow or get better or level up in life if we only took the easy way .\nHard things like studying for a degree pay off .\nThey might not be the most fun activities , but they benefit us .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt might seem easier to continue to eat junk food and not work out ( in the short term ) and changing to healthier habits might seem difficult .\nBut , without the change , your health will never change .\nSee what I mean ?\nSo , how do we trick our brains into thinking that hard things are fun or even enjoyable ?\nYour mindset has a lot to do with how you view certain tasks .\nFor example , if you tell yourself \u201c I hate exercising and eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain that these two activities are hard .\nYour brain will listen to what you tell it , and you will dread doing things like exercising or changing your diet .\nInstead of thinking negative , focus on the positive .\nReframe it .\nFind a workout you like and tell yourself how much you enjoy it .\nAnd make it enjoyable .\nIf you can make a hard task fun , you will WANT to do it .\nAnd your brain will produce dopamine to keep you motivated to do it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOVE doing something hard , you can reframe your mind .\nYou might not want to study , but think of the positive : studying will help you accomplish your goal of getting your dream job , and you will be financially stable .\nFocus on your WHY .\nIf you don \u2019 t know what yours is , ask yourself , what is pushing me towards change ?\nYou might think losing weight is hard , but deep down you want to feel your best .\nFocus on that , not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising .\nInstead of saying , \u201c I am going to have to finish four years of school to get my degree.\n\u201d Break up your big goal into little ones .\nThis makes the goal more manageable and it also allows you to celebrate your accomplishments , which will fuel your journey with even more dopamine .\nIf we view an activity as more painful than pleasurable , the odds are , that we are going to avoid it at all costs .\nAnd the same goes for bad habits .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicotine makes you feel and that is all you are thinking about when trying to quit , it \u2019 s going to be hard .\nBut , if you recall how bad smoking makes you feel and how much you don \u2019 t want it to destroy your health and appearance , it becomes much easier to quit smoking .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

"There are a lot of things that go on around us daily that could easily destroy our planet .\nThat might sound sensational or like I am fearmongering , but really , I am being 100 % serious .\nThink about it : we have near-Earth objects ( asteroids , comets , meteors ) that come zooming by at a very close range regularly .\nSome have even been labeled by NASA as \u2018 potentially hazardous ,

\u2018 coronal mass ejection.\n\u2019 When they strike our planet , they can cause power grid malfunctions , and radio interference and have even ( recently ) caused Starlink satellites to fall from the sky .\nThese are the mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronal mass ejections range in severity , with some being extremely intense and others ( most ) being pretty mild .\nMassive ones tend to happen every 100 years or so .\nThe Carrington Event was the most powerful storm in recorder history and was so intense that it caused \u2018 streams of fire \u2019 to come pouring out of the phone circuits .\nBack then , we didn \u2019 t have internet , but the telephone ( telegraph ) was the hot technology of that time .\nThe aurora lights , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemisphere very much , were suddenly massive and filling the sky with all sorts of colors , making many believe the world was over .\nAnd massive storms berated the planet , according to History.com .\nFollowing the Carrington event was another storm in 1921 that caused telephone stations in Sweden to catch fire .\nAnd then another hit Canada , causing power outages for over 9 hours .\nIf a storm like this hit Earth now , it would cause a variety of social and economic disruptions , according to a 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn another more recent study , scientists pointed out that such an event would cripple the global internet infrastructure , causing global outages for days .\nFor each day the internet was down , it would cost trillions .\nThe reason for this is that compared to 1859 , 1921 , and 1989 , we are globally dependent on power grids , the internet , and GPS .\nWe have a sky filled with satellites .\nTimes have changed , and much of our economy depends on our modern conveniences .\nAdditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what would happen to all of those internet modems we have in pretty much every household across ( at least ) the Western world ?\nSolar storms move in cycles .\nRight now , despite there being a lot of solar storms , most of them have been pretty mild .\nHowever , according to researchers , we are in a cycle that will peak in July 2025 .\nBecause these events typically happen once a century , it \u2019 s always possible that one could happen at really any moment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ do get about 8 hours \u2019 notice because that is around the time it takes for the particles to reach Earth

parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset , they would yell and scream for you to \u201c Stop crying !\n\u201d or tell you that you were fine and to be quiet .\nBecause many of us grew up being invalidated , we

can also be tied to a multitude of other traumas .\n3 .\nYour parents compare you to others .\nGrowing up and even now , your parents may play the comparison game .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart like your

in relationships with toxic people because it is what they grew up being accustomed to because it is how their parents raised them .\nEnabling is toxic , plain , and simple .\nI have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug addicts or simply growing up dependent on their parents .\nTheir parents go around talking about how bad they have gotten , all the while handing them wads of cash to go spend on more drugs or to

were most of my friends .\nHowever , as we learn more and more about the human mind , psychologists are beginning to see how much a more gentle approach can impact little ones for the best possible outcome .\nWhat does gentle parenting sound like to you ?\nYou might be envisioning a hippie mom with dreadlocks carrying her baby on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or something along those lines .\nPut simply , gentle parenting is simply mindful parenting that is conscious of the fact that children are just tiny people , who deserve empathy and understanding .\nIt \u2019 s not asserting some wild or too lenient approach to discipline or anything like that .\nThe best aspect of gentle parenting is that you will begin to notice that your kids do listen when you approach them with empathetic communication .\nNot only that , but their bond to you will also deepen .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either .\nHere are 8 gentle parenting techniques you can use .\nIt might sound odd , but if you \u2019 ve ever gotten frustrated by the way someone spoke to you , then you likely already realize deep down that communication and delivery are key .\nWhen someone demands you do something or criticizes you to get you to do something , the first thing that happens is that an emotional response is evoked .\nWith kids , this can make a major difference .\nTry speaking to your child in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen .\nFor example , instead of saying , \u201c It \u2019 s time to go to bed .\nGet going NOW.\n\u201d say , \u201c It \u2019 s time for bed .\nWould you like to brush your teeth first or put on your pajamas ?\n\u201d When your child is upset , it is for a reason .\nIf they are on the verge of a meltdown , level with the .\nSit down and ask them what is going on .\nIf they won \u2019 t tell you , remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , and to be understood .\nIf they are hungry , they are going to have a hard time dealing with their emotions .\nSo , feed them .\nOftentimes , it might seem like a child is pitching a fit for no good reason but in reality , there are plenty of reasons when you think about it .\nIf your child is upset or not listening , try a different approach .\nIf they are getting upset , acknowledge it .\nSay , \u201c I can see you are upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if I don \u2019 t feel good .\nIt \u2019 s okay to be upset.\n\u201d Be supportive of your little one .\nIf you notice they are hesitant to do something , assure them it will be okay .\nIf you notice them feeling insecure , cheer them on .\nWhen your child is modeling good behavior , water that seed .\nFor example , you may notice them cleaning their room all on their own for the first time .\nGive them a special treat and mention how happy you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean up their room .\n\u201c I noticed how clean your room is .\nDoesn \u2019 t it feel nice to have a clean space and to do that all by yourself ?\nI am so proud of you !\n\u201d Listen to your child .\nStow away your phone and sit down with your child one on one .\nAsk them questions or just let them vent .\nChildren are going to do what they see from us , in most cases .\nIt isn \u2019 t \u201c do as I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , monkey

what you want your child to do , or what you think they could do- but on what they are capable of .\nAs an example , a 1 1/2-year-old may have a hard time sitting still at a restaurant .\nYou may want them to , and you may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they don \u2019 t it \u2019 s likely because they simply aren \u2019 t there yet .\nBe gentle and help guide them to that outcome as they develop .",

abuse that involves someone working to make another person doubt their own reality .\nThe thing about this is that sometimes , as parents , we do this without thinking .\nMaybe it \u2019 s just because our parents did it for us , or maybe it \u2019 s because we just don \u2019 t realize that is what we are doing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it and either don \u2019 t care or have more nefarious

gaslighting is a tricky subject , and there are many ways in which gaslighting can happen .\nHere are some examples of what gaslighting your child might look like .\nNo matter what the problem is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no small problems because everything your child does cause you to react in a major way .\nIn turn , it \u2019 s likely your child will keep you at a distance or hold back details because they don \u2019 t want to upset you .\nIf this is you , it might be time to consider speaking with a therapist about emotional reactions or even try some mindfulness techniques to get a hold

, when you correct your child about how they think or feel , you are telling them that they can \u2019 t trust themselves .\nAnd this can create major problems for them as far as self-esteem goes

especially adults and parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault with your kids , it \u2019 s really important not to .\nFirst , if you do wrong and don \u2019 t admit it , they are going to question the fact that they feel you did them wrong , which will make them doubt their own experiences .\nAnd secondly , it \u2019 s a good lesson to teach your kids to take responsibility for their actions .\nA lot of parents do this with the best of intentions .\nFor example , your child might be screaming and crying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( AKA help them to stop crying . )\nSo , instead of soothing them , you say , \u201c Stop crying , it \u2019 s not that bad.\n\u201d When you do though , you are sending the message that their emotions are invalid .\nInstead , acknowledge how they feel and let them know it

the number of people who fall under the diagnostic criteria for narcissism is growing .\nBecause of that , it \u2019 s more important than ever to know the signs of a narcissistic relationship so you can take the proper measures for your situation .\nNarcissists are individuals who have a personality disorder known as a narcissistic personality disorder .\nMuch like sociopathy ( anti-social personality disorder ) this disorder falls under cluster b personality disorders .\nTypical symptoms include a lack of empathy , a grandiose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dysfunctional ( often abusive ) interpersonal tendencies .\nIf you \u2019 ve never been in a relationship with one , consider yourself lucky .\nFor those who do end up in relationships with one , it can be extremely bad for your mental health , because they tend to emotionally tear down and even torment those closest to them .\nIf you believe you are in a relationship with one but are still trying to figure out whether or not you are right , you \u2019 ve come to the right place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim .\nOne of the biggest signs of a narcissist is when someone is always the victim in their eyes .\nNot just once or twice , because hey , everyone has been victimized at some point , but when someone has been the victim of every encounter they \u2019 ve ever shared with others , they are lying .\nAnd it \u2019 s likely if you ever part ways with them , they will cry victim to you too .\n2 .\nThey are always manufacturing chaos .\nNarcissists get bored with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they crave being the center of attention , so when things aren \u2019 t lively enough for them , they will make drama happen .\nWatch for them to pick fights or even manufacture some type of drama .\n3 .\nYou are afraid to leave them .\nWhen you think of leaving , you worry they might either harm themselves or harm you .\nEven if they wouldn \u2019 t physically harm you ( because all narcissists are NOT violent ) you fear they may smear your name or do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for their actions .\nWhenever they are wrong , they are never able to admit fault .\nEveryone else is always to blame .\nWhen they do wrong to you , they turn things around like it was your fault .\nGaslighting happens when someone works to make you doubt your sanity and thus your account of reality .\nExamples of this might be if your partner lied to your face and when you called them out , they said that you must have misheard them .\nSometimes , you could witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call you a liar .\nNarcissists view people as an extension of themselves .\nPeople aren \u2019 t individuals who have their own will , they are merely pawns the narcissist uses to get what they want .\nNarcissists are extremely fake .\nThey will pretend to be someone they are not , but if you know them well enough , you will see that mask pop right off .\n8 .\nThey treat you like you are disposable .\nWhile the narcissist can not stand to be treated as anything other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick to tell you how replaceable you are .\nThey might even mention other romantic prospects or tell you that no one will ever love you as they do .", "author":

more than them feeling good about themselves , it is also about them believing in themselves and what they can accomplish .\nA child without confidence won \u2019 t reach their goals or try for their dream job .\nInstead , they will sit on the sidelines and take what they can get .\nAnd I don \u2019 t know about you , but I want to raise my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want them to believe they can have whatever they are willing to work for .\nI want them to have the world .\nAnd the thing is , building confidence in your child isn \u2019 t as daunting as it seems .\nThere are simple habits that will help you to reach that goal .\nHere are 12 ways to boost your child \u2019 s confidence .\nEach week , especially with older kids who understand , sit down and ask them what is important to them .\nSome weeks , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , it may be their accelerated reading goal or even just finishing their favorite game .\nWhatever it is , write their goals down .\nKeep them simple and achievable ( but not too easy . )\nAnd encourage them to make a plan to help them get there .\nWhen they reach their goal , mark it off or highlight it for them to see it and feel a sense of completion .\nGive your child age-appropriate special tasks .\nAn example of this might be getting your 10-year-old to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out .\nOr , getting your toddler to wipe down the coffee table as you cheer them on .\nYou can not expect your child to be confident if you aren \u2019 t .\nIf you have problems with being confident , now is a good time to work on those , so you can set a good example .\n4 .\nAllow them to fail .\nAs a parent , it might seem counterproductive to let your child fail .\nHowever , to see that failure is not the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can learn from failure , they need to experience it .\nSo , step to the side and let them learn through failure from time to time .\nWhen they make a mistake , don \u2019 t make a huge ordeal out of it .\nLet them make their mistake , explain what went wrong , and move forward .\nIf you make a big deal out of mistakes , they are going to be terrified of trying anything .\nEncourage them to participate in positive self-talk .\nIf you hear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-talk in a more positive direction .\nFor example , they might say , \u201c I can \u2019 t do it .\nI \u2019 m not smart enough , \u201d you could counter with , \u201c That \u2019 s not true , you have been making all a \u2019 s and b \u2019 s and doing a great job at everything you try .\nNo one is perfect when they first start , you are

growth there .\nSo , instead , push them a little bit at a time to get out of their comfort zone .\nDo it slowly , you don \u2019 t want to shock them .\nBut little by little , they will learn that just outside of their comfort zone is where they want to be .\n8 .\nAsk for their opinion .\nAsk them for their opinion about things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the new furniture you are looking at , or what they would cook for dinner if it was up to them .\nWhen you ask them about small things for their opinion , they can see that you value their opinion .\nThis is another thing that you need to be age-appropriate about , but it \u2019 s important to give your child chores .\nGiving them a set of chores to do each week will give them something to be responsible over , and in turn , will build confidence .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPay attention to your child , what they enjoy and what they are good at .\nHelp them to find their thing and once they find it- encourage them to get better and better .\nLet them know that perfection is impossible .\nDo this by embracing imperfection and letting them know how important it is to have flaws .\nDon \u2019 t reward their talent or praise sheer talent , instead , experts say to praise their efforts .\nFor example , if they passed their test \u2013 don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so gifted , \u201d instead , say , \u201c You worked hard and studied for

allow their child to think for themselves .\nRepeat after me : your child is not an extension of yourself , your child is an autonomous individual .\nToo often , parents who have strong core beliefs try to push their beliefs off onto their children .\nWhen their child has their own opinion , they get struck down .\nThe problem with this is that you are removing your child \u2019 s desire to think for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to have healthy relationships , you need to model boundaries for them .\nTo do this , you need to have boundaries with them .\nExamples of this , are respecting their need for privacy , not inviting them into your adult problems , and not talking bad about their other parent around them .\nOf course , there are plenty of other boundaries , but the point is , that a lack of boundaries is toxic and destroys your child \u2019 s ability to have relationships later on .\n5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt might sound counterproductive to let your child fail , but hear me out .\nIf you are always stepping in when your child is about to fail and helping them out , they will never learn to face adversity on their own .\nIn turn , when failures happen in the real world , they are either going to sink or swim .\nPreparing them by allowing them to face failure early on will help them out immensely .\nAccording to psychotherapist and author Amy Morin , praising your child \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong message .\n\u201c Kids who only hear praise for their achievements ( rather than for putting in the hard work it took to get there or a willingness to be brave and try something where they may fail ) may grow up to become adults who think they need to succeed at all costs .\nThey might be more willing to lie , cheat , and steal , so they can come out a winner , \u201d she says .\nPerfection is not possible .\nWhen you hold your child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to reach it and will either be in constant pursuit of it , or they will give up altogether .\nThe thing is , that neither of those is conducive to the real world .\n8 .\nThey try to be their child \u2019 s friend , not their parent .\nDon \u2019 t get me wrong , I am not saying that you can not be your child \u2019 s friend .\nWhat I am saying is that being their parent should come first .\nAs parents , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boundaries , and rules for our kids .\nAllowing them to do whatever they want will only cripple them in the long run .\nWe \u2019 ve all seen that parent who is always hovering over their child , never allowing them to have any space of their own .\nWhenever the child spills something on them , their mom is right there to wipe them down and always catches them before they fall .\nHonestly , the mom is pretty much an extension of the child .\nThe problem with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their development .\nThey need room to fail and they need independence .\nThe helicopter parent only causes anxiety and dependence on the parent .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

to be informed about .\nI really felt like what Lolo has to say is informative and , at the very least , discussion worthy .\nHere are the 7 ways to teach kids consent without mentioning sex .\n1 .\nTeach them to say no .\nWhile it may seem insignificant , she says , the impact of teaching kids to say no can go a long way .\nShe cites situations like in African cultures where kids aren \u2019

respect their decisions when they do.\n\u201d 3 .\nTeach them to ask for permission .\nConversely , teach them to ask for permission before touching other people .\nEven if the person is family or someone close , she asserts that it is helpful to encourage them to ask .\nThis shows them what consent means from all angles .\n4 .\nHave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c In our society , it can be very easy for young boys to think and view others as objects meant to fulfill their own needs .\nWhen boys have men they trust and admire be vulnerable with them , it opens up a chance for them to see the world with compassion , allowing them to become more sensitive and respectful of others , \u201d she says .\n5 .\nTeach them not to move people with their hands .\nShe explains that the best way to teach this is to model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we do this with people that are older than us ; it is easier for us to move our peers or someone younger out of the way .\nSo if we have the patience to wait and allow the person older to move on their own , we can do the same with people younger or our peers.\n\u201d 6 .\nTeach them not to give out other people \u2019 s information without permission .\nBefore giving out information , children should be taught to ask for the person \u2019 s permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c No matter how close they are to the person , it shows respect for their privacy.\n\u201d Last but not least , she says , that every moment can be a teachable moment .\nAnother thing she says that I felt was really impactful is to think of everything you heard as a child from people you trusted that made you feel bad .\n\u201c So imagine if those remarks were healthy and positive comments , \u201d she concludes .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

criticism won \u2019 t hurt .\nThe difference is watching how often and how you criticize .\nWhen all you do is criticize , it \u2019 s time to re-evaluate .\n2 .\nYou discipline to punish , not teach .\nThere is a major misconception that discipline equals punishment .\nIn reality , discipline is teaching your child how to navigate the world responsibly .\nYes , this can be done through the use of punishment , but the whole point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s to teach .\nBe mindful of how you discipline your child and stay open to making sure that you are disciplining to teach them .\nGaslighting is when you intentionally or unintentionally make your child doubt their perspective .\nAn example of this might be when your child is telling how something happened , and you interrupt and say , \u201c No , that \u2019 s not what happened .\nYou are being dramatic.\n\u201d Or if your child tries to say how they feel and you say , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel.\n\u201d Doing this

telling them that they are not enough and that something is wrong with them that needs to be changed .\nYou might not mean it that way , but kids internalize things , so be careful .\n5 .\nYou put adult problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every aspect of life , and even with your kids .\nDon \u2019 t talk bad about your child \u2019 s other parent , or bring them into your adult problems .\nIt might sound obvious , or it might not , but adult problems will do nothing but place additional stress on your child \u2019 s back that they are not equipped to handle .\n6 .\nYou fly off the handle .\nWe

you are a parent , you \u2019 ve probably already been given more pieces of useless parenting advice that made you roll your eyes .\nI know I have .\nSo it got me thinking : what are other pieces of advice that are being passed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honest , I was shocked by some of these and shocked about how much BAD advice was floating around in the world .\nHere are the ones that stood out the most .\n1 .\nDon \u2019 t give them a treat if they haven \u2019 t finished their dinner .\nWhile you may not want your child to live off junk , having a treat now and then is fine .\nHowever , teaching your child that they have to shove their mouths full of food ( even that they aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can have a treat sends a bad message and cultivates bad eating habits .\nKeep dessert to a now and then treat and let it be a part of their dinner .\nWe \u2019 ve all heard it : if you don \u2019 t make your child share , they will be greedy .\nFirst and foremost , it \u2019 s just not in their development at an early age to understand sharing .\nAnd second of all , while sharing is nice , forcing them to is imposing on their boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone forced you to let someone borrow something of yours ?\n3 .\nRub whiskey on their gums to soothe a toothache .\nI have heard this so many times , especially from older people .\nAnd while admittedly , whiskey has helped a toothache of mine , it isn \u2019 t a great option for a child for several reasons .\nA. it \u2019 s a controlled substance that does produce a high .\nB. alcohol burns SEVERELY before it numbs-which ultimately will traumatize your child .\nAnd C. IT \u2019 S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teething ring .\n4 .\nMake sure they clean their plates .\nOnce upon a time , it was suggested to tell kids to clean their plates .\nNow , we realize that when we force kids to shovel down the food they are not hungry for , it destroys their ability to discern their hunger cues and thus destroys their relationship with food .\nWhile it is true that sleep-deprived parents should sleep when they can , it \u2019 s also important to note that time is likely some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s reasonable to expect that they might want to take that time to catch up with a friend , pay their bills , or take a bath .\n6 .\nToo much affection will spoil your child .\nFirst and foremost , babies NEED affection .\nSamantha Radford , Ph.D. , and founded of Evidence-Based Mommy says , \u201c Babies are biologically designed to be held and carried , \u201d she says .\n\u201c The kids who have the most separation anxiety aren \u2019 t the ones who are frequently held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tough it out.\n\u201d 7 .\nDon \u2019 t let little boys whine , it makes them weak .\nLet \u2019 s just nip this in the bud now .\nLittle boys have emotions , and when they whine , they aren \u2019 t being girly or weak , they are being human .\nThey are trying to tell you they need something .\nPlease do not listen to people who tell you to invalidate their emotions .\n8 .\nSpank your child , or they won \u2019 t learn how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect .\nEven the National Pediatric Association agrees and says that not only is spanking ineffective , it also damages the relationship between parent and child and destroys your child \u2019 s mental health .\n9 .\nLet them choose their activities .\nIf I let my child choose the activity every time , we would be painting the walls with finger paints and eating crackers all day long .\nAnd while I am sure he \u2019 d have a blast , no thanks .\n10 .\nNever let your kids see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one .\nIf your child never sees you fail , they will never see you overcome failure .\nAnd they will have an unrealistic view of what being an adult human is like .\nNow , I am not saying to share all of your experiences with your child , please exercise boundaries .\nBut , don \u2019 t hide failure from them .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

being left alone , so oftentimes new mommas carry their babies close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t anything new , though , because there is a ton of evidence that supports pre-historic parents carrying their infants with them everywhere they went .\n5 .\nElders pitch in to help with kids .\nThis is unfortunately one thing that could be wearing away as time goes on .\nMany modern kids don \u2019 t get to enjoy the fullness of a family , complete with elder caregivers .\nBut , that doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s any less important now than it was back then .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that the wisdom

caused satellite disruptions as they move through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers present evidence they have gathered from Southern Africa about the South Atlantic Anomaly , which covers Chili to Zimbabwe .\nThere is no doubt about it- the field is becoming weaker , but why ?\nWhile our Earthly magnetic poles do shift from time to time , this typically happens over time .\nThe last time a massive shift

your losses , or your relationship comes to an end for any other reason , the last thing you likely want is to dream about your ex .\nBut , it does happen .\nOf course , there are a number of reasons for this , both psychological and spiritual .\nThe reason for your situation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your instincts as you read over this list or touch base with a relationship psychic who can also help you to take a deep dive into your own personal situation .\nHere are 9 reasons why people dream about their exes .\n1 .\nYou miss how you felt in your life at that time .\nWhile you may have had a rocky relationship , your life during the course of the relationship wasn \u2019 t that bad .\nIt might be that you had a different career that you were happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were just going your way , in spite of how bad the relationship was .\nSo , your mind is connecting those bits of happiness to your ex and causing them to resurface in the dream .\n2 .\nYou have unfinished business with them ( a lack of closure . )\nIf a relationship ends abruptly , much like losing someone to death , it can leave you feeling like there is unfinished business .\nOur minds do not like a lack of closure , so we seek it by reliving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your partner may not have been a great boyfriend or girlfriend , perhaps they were a great friend .\nUnfortunately , while you can \u2019 t go back to being friends in most cases , you may still wish you could .\nSo , during your dreams , you revisit the good times .\n4 .\nYou are on their mind .\nIn some cases , because we are all spiritually connected to one another , it \u2019 s quite normal to dream about an ex because they are thinking about you .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , it puts them on your wavelength and vice versa .\nIf you had an abusive partner , who was emotionally or physically abusive , you can be left with scars .\nUnfortunately , this can also cause flashbacks , nightmares , and strange dreams about the person .\n6 .\nYou are still angry at them .\nIf you still haven \u2019 t resolved your feelings for this person , you will continue to dream about them .\nWhile unresolved love or other forms of closure are typical , being angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to resurface in your dreams , too .\n7 .\nThey made you feel more secure .\nIf you are feeling shaky and insecure in life , and your ex made you feel stable and secure , you may end up dreaming about them .\nWhile this can be misleading , making you feel like you miss them or need them , it \u2019 s more so a feeling they made you feel than their actual presence .\nDuring times of loneliness , our minds can be our own worst enemy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that loneliness can cause us to miss people that we shouldn \u2019 t miss , or people that are a part of our past lives .\nRemember , your ex is your ex for a reason .\n9 .\nA conflict is resurfacing that is similar to one that surfaced during your time together .\nIf you are going through a similar struggle in your life as what you were during the time you were with your partner , it can cause you to dream of them .\nFor example , let \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member while you were with your ex , and now you \u2019 ve lost another .\nThis triggers you to dream of your ex , which makes you question whether you should be with them or not .\nWhile this is normal , it \u2019 s likely best to leave the

claims saying that you are the best thing that ever happened to them or their soulmate .\nOftentimes , they come on way too strong .\nThen , they will work their way towards devaluing you and berating you .\nSo you don \u2019 t leave them , they will work back to idealization , and this cycle will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTriangulation can happen in a few ways .\nOne way is when your partner wants to make you jealous , they will begin hanging around someone of the opposite sex ( or someone they could be attracted to ) to put you on edge .\nWhen you call them out , they will call you crazy or jealous .\nAnother way is if you are disagreeing , they will bring in an outsider to the situation , tell them their side and pit them against you .\nNarcissists are masters of distorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , they always distort the situation to make themselves look better .\nAnd in most cases , the narcissist is a distortion or a manipulation , because they carefully curate their image .\nGaslighting is a form of manipulation in which the manipulator works to make their victim look insane .\nFor example , they may go around lying and calling this person crazy , and then , they will work to make the person doubt themselves .\nSome go to great lengths to do this , by purposely doing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did it , even when their victim saw what they did with their own eyes .\nAfter a while , this can destroy someone \u2019 s perceptions .\nStonewalling is when someone completely stops talking to you during a conversation , debate , or argument and won \u2019 t allow you

when a child is dealing with anger .\nEven worse , if the wrong tactic is used to alleviate your child \u2019 s anger , it may only make it worse .\nIn many cases , when our child becomes angry or

@ @ , \u201c Hey I didn \u2019 t get much rest last night , so I am not feeling my best.\n\u201d Instead , they tend to show us they don \u2019 t feel well by lashing out .\nWhile it may be your first

.\nNot only will it benefit you , because it will mean that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it will help them to thrive and flourish in their lives moving forward .\nAt the moment , when your child is yelling , screaming , and throwing things all over the place , it will feel tempting to just give your child what they want .\nHowever , when you do this , you are enforcing bad behavior , which is

changing how you approach your child or changing the consequences or your child \u2019 s limits , they aren \u2019 t going to be able to learn from their mistakes .\nWhen your child is acting up , give them a moment to calm down and then sit down and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly listen to them .\nDon \u2019 t talk over them or make them feel bad or punish them \u2013 just listen .\nA lot of times , your child isn \u2019 t angry , they simply need something .\n( Food , sleep , and attention is the primary things that they will get upset about . )\n5 .\nEncourage them to use their words .\nWhen

feel ?\n\u201d Use real-life moments as teaching tools .\nFor example , if a little girl at the park is upset and crying , say , \u201c Do you see that little girl ?\nShe is upset because she fell.\n\u201d Or , \u201c Your brother is crying because he is tired and needs rest.\n\u201d Using real-life moments and giving emotional causes/words will help your little one to better understand

that incriminate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how much you can prove what happened , no matter how true what you are saying is , it doesn \u2019 t matter .\n3 .\nThey act as though they know you better than you know yourself .\nParents who gaslight tend to act as though they know their child more than their child knows themselves .\nFor example , a son might say , \u201c I am so cold , \u201d and then their mom will say , \u201c No , you aren \u2019 t , you are fine.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making her son doubt his perceptions .\nGaslighting parents tend to bring in others against their children to affirm themselves .\nOne way they will do this , is to refer to their child as crazy , delusional , or overly-sensitive to others , making their child seem inept .\nThen , when they are needing backup , they run to those people and tell them how wrong their child is , and bring the others in to make their child feel like they are beneath them .\nOver time , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s

fault .\nMissed career opportunity ?\nIt \u2019 s their kid \u2019 s fault .\nEverything is ALWAYS exaggerated when it comes to gaslighting parents .\nThey make a mountain out of a molehill when it

Real, According To Recent Study", "content": "If you are someone who tends to fall down the proverbial rabbit hole from time to time , then you \u2019 ve likely heard the term \u2018 Mandela Effect.\n\u2019 If you haven \u2019 t , it \u2019 s basically when an entire group of people has a false memory or account of the past , so much so that it leads some to believe our reality has been tampered with in some way or that we have moved or jumped timelines .\nExamples of this are that a large group of people remember Darth Vader saying \u201c Luke I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , he said , \u201c No , I am your father.\n\u201d Others claim the Berenstain bears were the Berenstein bears , and there are many , many others .\nWhile this type of thinking has largely been associated with conspiracy theories for quite some time , just recently , some scientists did a study on the effect and found something quite interesting .\nA team of psychologists from the University of Chicago decided to test the theory and in their first experiment , they had participants look at different images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey used popular and classic examples of the Mandela Effect and then also added in controls .\nThen , they were asked to select the image they believed was the original and rate how confident they felt about their answers , and were told to estimate how many times they had seen it .\nThe item was considered to be a real \u2018 visual Mandela Effect \u2019 ( VME ) if it was consistently misremembered , the people were confident about their choice , and the wrong image was also consistently selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be well-known and understood Mandela Effects , they had a \u2018 significantly higher proportion \u2019 of being misremembered by the participants .\n\u201c These results indicate that these seven images ( C3PO , Curious George , the Fruit of the Loom logo , the Monopoly Man , Pikachu , the Volkswagen logo , and Waldo from Where \u2019 s Waldo ? )\nhad not only accuracies below chance , but also specific incorrect versions that were falsely recognized as the original , \u201d the researchers wrote in their paper .\n\u201c Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 VME-apparent.\n\u201d \u201c Furthermore , their accuracy is surprisingly low given the reported familiarity and confidence people had with these images , \u201d they added .\nNext , they showed them the correct images , asked that they study them , then asked them to recall them .\nWhen they were asked to decide between the VME and the correct image , the VME was consistently chosen over the studied version .\n\u201c This low accuracy for the VME image set is remarkable , given that participants had just seen the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet still chose the false version to indicate their memory , \u201d the team wrote .\nWhen asked about their choice , they would affirm what they thought they had seen through words , and still account incorrectly , and based on the VME .\n\u201c In fact , incorrect responses to VME-apparent images were more often attributed to the memory of the manipulated feature ( 66.54 percent ) than those to matched non-VME images ( 44.92 percent ) , which instead tended to be more guess-based.\n\u201d Some still aren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theorists believes it \u2019 s likely that the Mandela Effect is much like \u2018 The Schema theory \u2019 which is what happens when our brain creates a picture by filling in the missing information .\nOne example the study discovered in reference to the Mandela effect was when participants were asked to select the right Fruit of the Loom logo from the VME version , the correct version , and the manipulation .\n\u201c They could have picked the correct Fruit of the Loom logo , the Fruit of the Loom logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Loom logo with a plate underneath it , \u201d co-author Deepasri Prasad said in a press release .\n\u201c The fact that they chose cornucopia over the plate when plates are more frequently associated with fruit , is evidence against the idea that it \u2019 s just the schema theory explaining it.\n\u201d Unfortunately , while the group was able to observe the collective wrong memory among the group , with an astoundingly large percentage of them sharing the same false memory , they weren \u2019 t really able to pinpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people may be making consistent memory errors , even with extensive visual experience with the icon and without having experienced variants before , \u201d they write in their discussion .\n\u201c In sum , we revealed a set of images that cause consistent and shared false memories across people , spurring new questions on the nature of false memories .\nWe show that the VME can not be universally explained by a single account .\nInstead , perhaps different images cause a VME for different reasons.\n\u201d I \u2019 m still not entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , which could account for all of the strange changes

\u2019 kid .\nIn reality , having emotions doesn \u2019 t make them bad , and when a child continues to get angry and act out on the regular , it \u2019 s likely there is an underlying cause that needs to be addressed .\nChildren aren \u2019 t fully developed yet , meaning that they don \u2019 t know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t understand that they are angry because they are tired and not getting enough attention , they simply know that something doesn \u2019 t feel right .\nSo , instead of saying , \u201c Mommy , I am tired because I didn \u2019 t get enough rest , \u201d they throw things .\nThey scream .\nThey slap .\nAnd while it \u2019 s not a good idea to allow them to throw things and hit people , it \u2019 s also important to not act like they are the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to meet them where they are , understand where the behavior is coming from , and show them how to express their emotions healthily .\nHere are 9 reasons behind a child that is acting out in anger .\n1 .\nThey are going through a major life change .\n( New school , loss of a family member , parents arguing & fighting . )\nMajor life transitions that may not even seem like that big of a deal to us can feel huge on a child .\nExamples of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents changing jobs , and on a larger scale , they can happen if your child loses someone close to them .\nChildren need attention .\nTalking to their parents , playing with them , and spending time with them are what help to shape their development .\nWhen they are lacking attention , they will act out , because they NEED it .\n3 .\nThey are repeating behaviors they see from their parents .\nAnger is oftentimes a learned behavior .\nSo , if they see one or both parents throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s very likely they will repeat the same behavior .\nIf an angry person is living around the child , it might be valuable for that person to seek therapy .\nMuch like us , when kids feel uncomfortable ( i.e , tired ) they are going to feel agitated .\nMost adults can barely function in very little sleep , so imagine being a child .\nThere again , most adults I know can barely handle hunger without getting hangry .\nSo , it \u2019 s helpful to keep this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranky and it \u2019 s close to their meal time .\n6 .\nCoping through hormone changes caused by puberty .\nAround the time between 9-15 , most kids will begin transitioning from being a child to a teen .\nHormone changes associated with puberty can be intense .\nA typically calm child may end up easily getting agitated or frustrated for seemingly no reason .\n7 .\nThey feel like they have no control .\nFeeling a lack of control is an uncomfortable feeling .\nAnd while small children have barely any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling can lead them to feel tense , afraid , or anxious .\n8 .\nThey are a victim of trauma .\nPay attention to the signs of trauma .\nIf a child is being neglected or abused , they will act out .\nAnd anger is a MAJOR

.\nAnd sadly , his kids pay for his absenteeism in a myriad of ways .\nThe abusive dad is abusive , whether it be physically , emotionally , or otherwise .\nRegardless of the type of abuse , he leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s psyche for the rest of their life .\nUnfortunately , the damage is not easy to undo .\nThe addicted dad is addicted to either substance , drinking , gambling , or even sex .\nHis addictions always come before his child , and he is oftentimes resistant to getting help .\nBut , please don \u2019 t think I am attacking addicts here .\nIf you are an addict that is getting help , kudos to you , but for those who put their addictions before their kids , be wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows up to wisk his kids off to the amusement park or buy them a bunch of expensive things .\nOther

his kids get neglected on the other fronts .\nThe distracted dad has a bad tendency to get lost in his issues and oftentimes seems like he is lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found staring at a t.v , ignoring his kids , or staring at his phone .\nHe rarely engages with his kids and misses some of the most important moments in his kids \u2019 lives .\nHe always has somewhere else he needs to be .\nThe macho

theory of the world ending , I take it with a grain of salt .\nHowever , one that recently came to my attention piqued my interest and for good reason : it was proposed by Isaac Newton .\nIsaac Newton

a philosopher \u2019 s stone ( Hello , Voldermort ) and additionally pokes fun at all of the other scientists who don \u2019 t believe in God .\nBut , one thing that stands out in his notes is how he used mathematics combined with Biblical scriptures to come up with the date on which he felt like the world would end .\nHe used various start dates to come up with his conclusion , striving to find when it would be exactly 1,260 years that the corruption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start date he reached was 800 AD because that \u2019 s when Charlemagne would become the first holy Roman emperor .\nIn various manuscripts , Newton proposes that Christianity had been corrupted , and according to him , that was the cause of his choosing Charlemagne as the beginning of that corruption .\nWhat does it all mean ?\nNow , let me be clear , if you are unfamiliar with Christianity , the phrase \u2018 the end of the world , \u2019 likely sounds like the Earth suddenly burning up in flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case .\nIn Christianity , it \u2019 s theorized that when the Earth ends , Christ will come back and rule over Earth .\nDuring that time , Babylon would fall and there would be a kingdom of saints on Earth , and a millennium of peace would follow .\nHere \u2019 s some of the information taken from Newton \u2019 s notes : Prop .\n1 .\nThe 2300 prophetic days did not commence before the rise of the little horn of the He Goat .\n2 .\nThose day [ sic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] ter the destruction of Jerusalem & ye Temple by the Romans A.\n[ D . ]\n70 .\n3 .\nThe time times & half a time did not commence

tell little boys that they aren \u2019 t allowed to feel anything too deeply , lest they be called weak , girly , or whiny .\nAnd while this double standard has been present for quite some time , we are beginning to understand from a psychological standpoint how dangerous it is to force little boys to suppress their emotions .\nWhen I was growing up , I always noticed that when little boys would fall down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion , our elders were quick to try to shut it down .\n\u201c Stop crying .\nYou sound like a little girl , \u201d they would say .\nOr , \u201c Stop crying , boys don \u2019 t cry .\nYou are going to be a man one day , act like it.\n\u201d It \u2019 s such a sad thing that having emotions is regarded as weak , and the absence of them ( coldness ) was once regarded as strong/manly .\nEven now , I hear people act as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you weak .\nThis couldn \u2019 t be further from the truth .\nWhen we tell little boys not to cry , not to whine , not to be \u2018 weak , \u2019 we send the message that emotions = weakness .\nIn reality , emotions are the human condition .\nThey are intrinsically wired into us , and for good reason : they help us to survive .\nFeeling love is what makes us bond with our friends , family , and loved ones .\nFeeling sadness allows us to process the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this life .\nFeeling happiness helps us find our way .\nAnd feeling angry is what helps us to protect ourselves from harm .\nEmotions are necessary , and the thing is , even if you force your son to repress his emotions , it \u2019 s not physically

etc . )\nHere are 9 reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s emotions .\n1 .\nStudies have linked aggression to the suppression of emotions .\nAccording to various studies and scientists , when we repress emotions , especially in young men , those emotions later come out in a new form : aggression .\nThis is likely because emotional regulation is happened upon through practice , and when you tell young men to just not have emotions , those emotions have to come out in some way .\n2 .\nThey will have healthier relationships if you don \u2019 t .\nBeing able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of being a part of a healthy relationship .\nWhen you can not manage your own emotions , it will be hard for you to communicate how you feel or even empathize with someone else .\nI would barter that the strongest men are the ones who are the most emotionally intelligent .\n3 .\nThey will have better mental health .\nOur emotions are the greater part of what makes up our mental health .\nEmotional suppression causes unresolved shame , feelings of worthlessness and identity confusion .\nBy helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process them , you are helping him to improve his mental health overall .\n4 .\nThey will be less likely to succumb to addiction .\nWhen you don \u2019 t learn how to manage and accept your emotions , you end up running from them .\nFor most , this happens through addiction .\nAnd it can be a food addiction , gambling addiction , alcoholism , drug addiction and even sex or technology addictions .\nRegardless , addictions destroy lives , relationships and mental health .\n5 .\nThey will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressing emotions can damage your heart ?\nAccording to the National Library of Medicine , stress and repressed emotions can cause high blood pressure .\nStress can literally kill you , and that is why it \u2019 s so important to learn the correct way to manage it .\nAnd while that might seem like something that would only affect an adult , the American Heart Association disagrees .\n6 .\nThey will be more responsible .\nPart of emotional intelligence and teaching that and instilling it into your sons , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible .\nLearning how to communicate how you feel is tied directly to being able to admit when you are wrong and take responsibility for your actions .\n7 .\nThey will be more empathetic .\nEmpathy is so important .\nPeople who do not have

.\nAnd while it took some research , sometimes , and a bit of effort , I found a few effective tools for handling that type of behavior that I would like to share .\nBeing a parent is a tough job .\nThat job is only made harder by the hurdles we face along the way .\nTalking back begins in different stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on when they yell their first \u201c NO !\n\u201d back in your face shortly after you told them to do something .\nOthers are pretty peaceful for a while , and then see other kids talking back and doing the same .\nAnd others begin around the time when they are testing their boundaries .\nWhen a child talks back , it can be difficult not to get frustrated or even talk back and argue with them , but I am telling you , that \u2019 s the last thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only encourage them .\nSo , where do you begin ?\nI am glad you asked .\nHere are 8 ways to peacefully handle things when your child talks back .\nWhatever you do , keep your composure .\nThe moment you lose your cool , all bets are off .\nNot to mention , you are setting the wrong example by getting on your child \u2019 s level .\nIf you must , take a step back .\n2 .\nBe clear on what you expect .\nIn an understandable way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMake sure you keep it simple , but also that you are extremely clear .\n3 .\nSet and enforce consequences .\nIf you skip this step , all your effort will be for nada .\nAlso , make sure they know that there are consequences if they continue to talk to you in a disrespectful way .\nWhatever those consequences are , lay them out there and make sure they understand that if they continue , you will have to stand by them .\nIf they keep pushing you , enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t , they will not take you seriously .\n4 .\nRecognize and encourage the right behavior .\nA major part of disciplining your kids is making sure they understand what the right and wrong behaviors are .\nSo , when you catch them being respectful , following the rules , or otherwise acting at their best , let them know that their good behavior has not gone unnoticed .\n5 .\nWork to figure out if there are other underlying causes .\nRemember , a lot of times \u2018 bad \u2019 behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t necessarily bad , but is more so caused by some type of discomfort .\nFor example , when kids are tired , hungry , sick , or anxious , they are more likely to seem edgy or to act in ways that maybe aren \u2019 t the best .\nIf there are any underlying reasons that you can think of , keep them in mind .\n6 .\nAcknowledge their feelings , while also making yours clear as well .\nLet them know that you understand where they are coming from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut , also let them know if they continue to speak to you disrespectfully , you will end the conversation and enforce consequences .\nOftentimes , there may be patterns having to do with your child acting out .\nFor example , if any time they come back from a certain friend \u2019 s house with a bad attitude , it \u2019 s likely they have picked that up when they were with them .\nOr , if they act like that whenever they have a test at school , keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be ready .\n8 .\nGive respect and ask for it back .\nRespect is taught , so if you want your children to respect you , make sure that you respect them .\nAnd whenever they are slipping back into disrespectful behaviors , make sure that you remind them that you expect to be treated with the same respect you give them .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

Most People Overlook)", "content": "When we embark upon a journey to find and keep love , one of the last things we expect is that our relationship won \u2019 t last , especially when things start so well .\nHowever , it \u2019 s an unfortunate fact that some things just simply aren \u2019 t meant to be .\nAt the beginning of a relationship , we are so enamored by the spark that has been ignited , that we often overlook blaring red flags that something is not right .\nIf you \u2019 ve ever been in a failing relationship , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say that love blinds us , and I must say that I agree .\nIf you are in a relationship now and wonder if it will last , some tell-tell signs will show you if it is doomed for failure .\nIf you are wondering what those signs are , here are 10 .\n1 .\nYou have no common values .\nWhen the spark begins to fade , what we are left with is our true personality , our values , and our vision .\nWhen those things do not align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level it means that you have nothing in common .\nAnd unfortunately , this is a primary cause and predictor of relationship failure .\nAll couples fight and argue and that by itself is not a bad thing .\nHowever , when every discussion results in an argument , it is a blaring light shining on the fact that this relationship is not on a firm foundation .\nArguments can be good .\nWhen we argue , reach a resolution and hear each other out and work to move forward with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut , when the arguments are pretty much just you and your partner tearing each other apart , that is another story .\n4 .\nYou hold each other in contempt .\nHaving a disagreement or differences from time to time is normal .\nWhat is not normal is feeling contempt and outright hatred for your partner .\nWhile a disagreement can be resolved , if you do not like your partner , the relationship won \u2019 t last .\nIf it does , it \u2019 s going to be miserable .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cheating .\nWhen one or both partners begin to cheat on their partner , it \u2019 s a recipe for disaster .\nNow , I am not saying that there aren \u2019 t some relationships that recover from infidelity .\nMany relationships recover from that .\nWhat I am saying is that the chances of that are not in your favor .\nIt takes two people to make a relationship work .\nIf one person is invested in the relationship and the other doesn \u2019 t care , it simply can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t to say that it may not last for a bit before the invested person gives up , however , eventually , the person who cares will buckle from trying to carry the entire weight of the relationship on their shoulders .\n7 .\nYou are unclear on what the relationship is- because the other person refuses to define it .\nWhenever you try to define the relationship , your partner shuts you down .\nThey may claim they are happy with where things are , or that they aren \u2019 t ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see where things go , but if they are acting like a partner and benefiting from the relationship , like a partner , it only makes sense and is only fair that there is some sort of label on it .\nEspecially if that is what you are looking for .\nIf one person is wanting a commitment and the other is pulling back- you will end up stuck in a situationship .\n8 .\nThere is so much disrespect .\nRespect is the backbone of a relationship .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not respect you , believe me when I say that you don \u2019 t love each other .\nI \u2019 m sorry , but love and respect go hand and hand .\nAnd if someone continues to disrespect you , even after you have told them that is a boundary for you , it isn \u2019 t likely they will get better .\n9 .\nThere is no trust .\nMuch like respect , trust is fundamental to making a relationship last .\nWithout trust , one or both of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other .\nJealousy will take over and become the predominant force of the relationship , and that toxicity will gradually build until you either grow because of it , or you end up breaking up .\n10 .\nYou have a bad gut feeling about things .\nWhen a relationship is not right , we often have a feeling in our gut .\nWe may fight it by saying , \u201c But I love them , \u201d or \u201c but , we \u2019 ve been together for years , \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just know it.\n\u201d In reality- if you can not love and accept your partner RIGHT now for who they are , not who they are going to be , or if you find yourself making excuses , you probably need to listen to that gut feeling .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/10-signs-a-relationship-wont-last-that-most-people-overlook/", "published": "Fri, 02 Sep 2022 02:45:39 +0000", "published_utc":

@ @ @ to loosen the reigns a bit and give them space to grow , explore and learn .\nOnce upon a time , there was a major focus on family .\nThere were family reunions .\nKids had to be home by a

while breathing mindfully .\nOr , it could be splashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is- have it in mind and use it .\nAt times , the best thing you can do is redirect your child when they are trying your patience .\nFor example , if your child has asked you the same question 30 times , hand them a toy they love and ask them questions about it .\nOr , give them a sheet of paper and sit down and color with them .\nToddlers are very easy to distract and redirect , which will make it easier for you to calm yourself .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel overwhelmed , pull yourself back into the moment .\nRemind yourself to focus on the moment at hand .\nRemind yourself that you are working with a tiny human who needs your compassion .\nAnd remind yourself that no matter how frustrated you are , this too shall pass

reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or worse .\nAbove all DO NOT allow yourself to burn out .\nEven if that means taking some time for just you for some self-care , find a way to take it .\nYou can not pour

them in the position of an adult .\nAnd even if it seems \u2018 harmless \u2019 to put your child in that position , it \u2019 s quite detrimental to their emotional and psychological well-being .\nAs parents , it is our job to do just that : parent .\nOur role as a parent is supposed to always come first because our kids need us to be the stable , secure , and constant force in their life .\nWhen the roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in the position to be our security , our stability , and our constant , it \u2019 s not only unfair to them , it \u2019 s dangerous to them .\n\u201c Children should not be serving the intimate needs of a parent , or placed in the role of secret-keeper , \u201d explains Lisa M. Hooper , a researcher , and professor at the University of Louisville .\nHooper has taken part in extensive studies on the effects of parentification , which is basically when a parent places their child in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vice versa .\nExamples of this are when a mother talks down about her husband to her child .\nOr , when a parent discusses their intimate sexual lives with their kids .\nIn some cases , parents who are too unstable to take care of their kids end up depending on their kids to take care of them .\nIn turn , those children end up missing out on their childhoods because they are too busy trying to play the adult .\nChildren are not developmentally capable of handling adult situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents , and should not be placed in a position to carry that burden .\nIn many ways , this behavior is very close to neglect , because the needs of the parent are being placed before the needs of the child , and in many ways , the mental health of the child has been sacrificed accordingly .\nNow , let me be clear : there is a difference between reaching out to your child for love and support when you are feeling down and outright putting them in the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parentification happens either instrumentally , or on an emotional level , and either way , the results can be catastrophic to the mental health of the child .\nWhen it comes down to it , a parent is supposed to be the one who can tend to their child \u2019 s emotional needs and not vice versa .\nResearch has found that when parents lean on their children for emotional support , it typically leads to the child forming co-dependent relationships later on .\nEven worse , they are taught to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn turn , they end up leaning on substances , dealing with academic issues , and having social difficulties .\nFor those who are reading this that have been parentified , please know that what you have encountered is not your fault .\nAnd if you fear you are heading in the same direction with your children , it may be time to set healthy boundaries in your family .\nAdditionally , it couldn \u2019 t hurt to seek an outside mediator that is trustworthy .",

attracting the wrong people into your life .\nWhile there likely isn \u2019 t anything necessarily wrong with you , it is highly likely that after so many difficult situations , you are beginning to attract the wrong people .\nOftentimes , we attract the wrong people for several underlying reasons that we completely overlook .\nWhile this might sound crazy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the idea that we oftentimes accept and attract the wrong people without even realizing it .\nHere are 6 reasons why you are attracting the wrong people .\n1 .\nYou don \u2019 t believe that you deserve more .\nTo attract a better person , you have to believe that you deserve better .\nFor example , if you don \u2019 t love yourself or view yourself as being worthy of finding a guy that fits what you envision for yourself , then you are never going to try to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go for the guy that treats you like crap , because you feel like that is as good as it \u2019 s going to get .\nIf this is you , it might be time to spend some time getting to know and love yourself , as cliche as it sounds .\n2 .\nYou are attracted to emotionally unavailable types .\nIf the type of guy or gal that you tend to go for is someone that is also not emotionally available , you are going to end up in situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t want to commit .\nIn reality , if you go for the guy or gal who loves to lead an exciting and playful life , never really committing to anything , then you are always going to end up with someone afraid of commitment .\n3 .\nYou believe that there is a \u2018 perfect \u2019 person out there for everyone .\nWalt Disney did a great job of making wonderful movies that we can all cherish , but he also did a great job at making us believe some perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will come along and make our lives everything we ever wished for them to be .\nIn reality \u2013 NO ONE is ever going to be perfect .\nYou will always find a fault in another because they are human , and humans have faults .\nYou will have to accept them for who they are , even the parts you don \u2019 t like .\n4 .\nYou still haven \u2019 t done the right self-work .\nThis is going to make some people mad , but the thing is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself better , you are going to keep attracting people that haven \u2019 t done their self-work either .\nFor example , if you still haven \u2019 t faced your demons , you will likely end up dating your demons .\nIt might seem like a lot of time/work , but it is worth it to take a pause on dating and spend some time understanding yourself and working on the parts that continue to hold you back .\n5 .\nYou don \u2019 t know who you want .\nClarity is everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2018 right \u2019 person , if you don \u2019 t know what that means for you ?\nFor example , deep down , if you want a family man , but you continue to date the \u2018 party guy \u2019 hoping that one day he turns into a family man , it \u2019 s likely you are going to end up disappointed time and time again .\nI \u2019 m not saying people don \u2019 t change- but what I am saying is that instead of trying to push someone to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your values and goals in life .\n6 .\nYou change yourself to make others happy .\nDo you lie on your Tinder profile or to your potential new partners on a first date ?\nThis is a recipe for disaster .\nWhen you pretend to be someone else , to fit into what they are trying to partner up with \u2013 you are ultimately attracting the wrong person by default , because you are sending mixed messages .\nIt might be tempting to lie , because you like the person , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to guess whether you are right for them , because you have already put it out there about who you are and what you want .", "author": "Harley

and even about how Columbus sailed the ocean blue .\nHowever , one important thing that we were not taught about in school is money .\nIt seems odd to me in hindsight , because while I have NEVER had to use an algebraic equation in my adult life , I most definitely have had moments where I wish I knew more about finances .\nIf you can relate , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons too late .\nAs a parent , I have sworn to educate myself more and more about financial issues so that I can educate my child , so they don \u2019 t have to learn the same hard lessons I have .\nWhile there are so many that could be covered , the following 8 lessons are the ones I feel most people learn too late , and as my child gets older , this is what I plan to teach them about money .\n1 .\nThe true value of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of money , we think of what it will buy us .\nHowever , the true value of money isn \u2019 t what it can buy , but what it can offer you , which to me is freedom .\nThink about it : if you save up enough for retirement , you are buying yourself time to enjoy .\nWhen you have money saved up , you don \u2019 t have to constantly live in fear of losing your job or having an unexpected bill come up .\nWhen you save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rich , you are saving to ensure that everything is taken care of , and that is freedom .\n2 .\nYou will wait your whole life for money to just happen when , in reality , you need to be saving .\nMoney isn \u2019 t just going to happen to you in large sums .\nI mean , it could , but it \u2019 s not likely .\nAnd waiting on that to happen is just begging for things to fall apart .\nInstead of counting on a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as you can and stick it in a savings account for a rainy day .\nTo do yourself one better , invest that money in safe and lucrative investments to turn those small amounts into larger amounts .\nYou aren \u2019 t going to see a massive payout on your investments quickly unless it \u2019 s a super risky investment .\nA better course of action is to stick with something safe , steady , and nearly guaranteed .\nThe dividends may trickle in slowly , but be patient and stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 .\nDon \u2019 t count on being spoiled by anyone .\nAs a parent , I want my child to know first and foremost that while I don \u2019 t mind helping them , it \u2019 s best for them to not depend on me .\nAnd one thing is for sure , they need to make themselves independent because while I am not spoiling them , when you lean on anyone else to take care of you financially , you lose your freedom .\nA lot of people live either beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , the most intelligent thing to do is live below them .\nFor example , if you make $ 2000 per month , living off of credit cards to live above your means at around $ 4000 per month might sound like fun , but when disaster strikes ( and it will ) you are going to be put in a tough spot .\nInstead , live for $ 1500 and put the other $ 500 up !\n6 .\nBe wary of the financial advice others offer , especially those not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take everyone \u2019 s advice .\nEspecially in the age of social media , everyone thinks they know everything .\nDo your research .\n7 .\nIt \u2019 s okay to change your mind .\nI think a lot of us grow up thinking that by 18 we should have life figured out .\nHowever , that is not the way things go .\nSo , pick a

Summer and Winter solstice and a Spring and Autumn Equinox .\nAnd while these dates do serve to mark the seasons , they are also energetically empowered portals that push us through different levels along our journey .\nThe Autumn equinox of 2022 will happen on September 21 at 10 am PDT .\nDuring the equinoxes , we have equal parts of day and night , which is thought to bring us back to equilibrium .\nIt \u2019 s a time to recalibrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh start that is offered by the universe .\nJust a few days after the equinox , the Sun will enter into Libra , marking the beginning of Libra season , which is ironic , because Libra is also all about balance .\nDue to these two events coinciding , you will likely feel yourself trying to realign and reach equilibrium .\nEmbrace that urge , and make sure that you are prioritizing the load that you are carrying and that you let go of what is no longer serving you or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there is something in your life that you are not giving enough of your time and energy to ( that is worthy of it ) it \u2019 s time to make that shift .\nOftentimes , we focus too much on the things that don \u2019 t matter and not enough on the things that do , and this equinox is pushing you to transcend and finally find the balance that is necessary for your life .\nFor quite some time , spiritual traditions as old as civilization itself and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the equinox .\nAncient pagans , druids , shamans , and Native American tribes marked their calendars using the seasonal quarters and cross quarters of the year , not only for survival but also for spiritual growth .\nOf course , there is a good reason for this , because much like the seasons and phases found in the surrounding natural world , we humans also go through similar transformations during these times .\nDepending on the hemisphere , the equinox means different things .\nFor those in the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves begin to turn , pushing us closer towards winter and the ending cycle for many natural ecosystems on our planet .\nOn the other hand , those in the South will begin to see spring forward and into full swing , much like springtime for us Northerners .\nOver the past few months , we have experienced various retrogrades and with the seasons changing , it \u2019 s very much normal to feel a bit out of balance .\nAfter a long hot Summer ( at least for those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our planet needs a transitional period and needs to achieve a balance .\nWe aren \u2019 t that much different and that is what that energy is all about : finding harmony once more with ourselves , each other , our lives , and our paths .\nThis energetic portal is highly useful to mark a fresh start in your life , to try something new , to completely change your routine , whatever it is that you need right now , I suggest touching base with yourself and figuring out what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnother layer of this equinox pushes us to find a balance between the light and the dark .\nAll of us have light and dark within us , and when we are too \u2018 sunshine and rainbows \u2019 or too \u2018 abysmal \u2019 we can get pushed too far , which ultimately causes detrimental shifts in our vibration .\nFor example , when you focus too much on being positive and never face the darkness in your life , you will become jaded , grow to be naive , and in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you over .\nOn the contrary , if you are too dark , focusing too heavily on everything bad , you will get lost in that place , and it can be hard to escape .\nNow , it \u2019 s time to recalibrate .\nTake this time to tune into you .\nShut off your phone , sit outside in the quiet , and get to know yourself .\nAllow your thoughts to surface , don \u2019 t judge them , and don \u2019 t do anything with them .\nSimply notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allow them to pass .\nThink of the things going on in your life and compare them to the changing seasons .\nContemplate how you can bring more balance and harmony into your life- and what you will have to push harder for and what you will have to let go of .", "author": "Harley Manson",

thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 hoo-ha \u2019 instead of vagina because a lot of people do this to avoid having their child say those words .\nIn reality , it is much better to have your child know that

does try to touch them , they will know this is a no-no , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around them what is going on .\n2 .\nEnsure they understand what is private .\nEmphasize what the word private means .\nYou can use examples , like saying a toilet is a private place , while a kitchen is an open area or shared space .\nThen , relate those terms to body parts .\nInstead of using terms like \u2018 good \u2019 or \u2018 bad \u2019 touch , stick with terms like \u2018 safe \u2019 and \u2018 unsafe.\n\u2019 When discussing unsafe touching , it does not have to strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although that will be a major focus , of course .\nYou can also include pushing , hitting kicking , or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable ( see below . )\nMake it clear that secrets are NOT allowed because they can be harmful .\nMost predators will tell children to keep their abuse secret , so it \u2019 s a good idea to let them know that they shouldn \u2019 t keep secrets at home , with friends , family , or anyone .\n5 .\nHave your child name five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being touched in an unsafe way .\nMake sure your little one has a safety net of people they can alert if they ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe .\nHelp them to name up to five people that they can seek out for help and guidance .\n6 .\nTell them to NEVER allow anyone to take pictures of their private areas .\nIn modern times , technology has become very prevalent , so it \u2019 s possible someone may try to take pictures of your child .\nPlease emphasize that NO ONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people \u2019 s private parts .\nWe often make sure that our kids understand feelings like anger , sadness , etc , but the discomfort should also be a major point of discussion .\nExplain what discomfort is like ( heart racing , goosebumps , etc . )\nso they can identify it and let someone know how they feel .\n8 .\nLet them know they will NEVER get in trouble for talking to you about those uncomfortable feelings/ or anything they tell you about body safety .\nMake it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in trouble for letting you know what is happening .\nNo matter what someone says , they will never get in trouble for telling you .\n9 .\nEmpower them to speak up when something makes them feel uncomfortable .\nTell them any time they are feeling uncomfortable or someone is asking them to break the rules , to feel empowered to say NO

that cross our minds .\nHowever , in many cases , while it may be a hard thing to accept , we are the root of our own problems and are unintentionally causing our children to throw tantrums .\nBefore you come for me , hear me out .\nFirst and foremost , when a child acts out in a bad way , they aren \u2019 t doing so because they are trying to be \u2018 bad.\n\u2019 They are doing so because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion .\nWhile we shouldn \u2019 t accept that behavior , it \u2019 s important to understand the root causes of where they are coming from , so you can help them to process and express their emotions in a healthy way .\nWhile there are a number of reasons why a child will throw a tantrum , sometimes , our actions as parents are to blame .\nHere are 5 things parents do that cause their kids to throw tantrums .\n1 .\nNot knowing how to read your child \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall and all of a sudden , your little one begins to grow upset .\n\u201c I want to go home !\n\u201d they scream .\nYou get frustrated and tell them they need to calm down , you will leave as soon as you finish getting what you came for .\nWhile this may be one way to handle it , the best way would be to try to address the need behind their sudden change in demeanor .\nFor example , if they haven \u2019 t eaten in a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could say , \u201c Let \u2019 s go by the food court and grab a bite before we finish shopping because you seem hungry.\n\u201d Or just ask them , \u201c Would you like something to eat ?\n\u201d Adults get overstimulated all the time .\nNow , imagine a tiny human who is still developing and how easily they can get overstimulated .\nPerhaps you spent the morning watching cartoons and listening to music , then you went to the park which was loud , before going to the grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loud noises .\nIf you notice your child is getting upset as a reaction to too many stimuli , it may be best to give them a break and pick them back up later .\nWhen your child does something that is upsetting , you might feel the impulse to yell or to get upset back .\nBut , when you do that , you are adding gasoline to the fire .\nInstead , take a step back and calm yourself before responding .\n4 .\nNot embracing their need to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf you are sitting indoors all day , while they sit on a tablet or watch television , by the time dinner comes , it \u2019 s no wonder why they won \u2019 t sit still .\nThey have a ton of pent-up energy that they aren \u2019 t able to express .\nMake sure you are giving them time to play and run and get all of that out of their system .\n5 .\nNot allowing them some autonomy .\nIt \u2019 s tempting to jump in and help every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that seems challenging .\nBut , when you do this , you are robbing your child of something they instinctually crave : autonomy and independence .\nOf course , you can \u2019 t give them complete independence , but if they are trying to put together a Lego set by themselves , it won \u2019 t hurt to let them do so on their own .\nWhen you constantly take their power away , even in situations where it really would benefit them to do things on their own \u2013 they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel powerless .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/5-things-parents-do-that-cause-kids-to-throw-tantrums/", "published":

by the fact that there are so many conflicting dos and don \u2019 ts .\nAnd while that might be true , there are some parenting mistakes that pretty much all parenting experts agree should be avoided at all costs .\nDon \u2019 t get me wrong , I do understand that no two kids are alike , so the advice given to one parent might not work for another .\nHowever , there again , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and children .\nTo put it bluntly \u2013 there are some things that , no matter how you cut it , just don \u2019 t work or will hinder or harm your child more than anything .\nBelow , I have listed the 10 parenting mistakes that pretty much all parenting experts agree should be avoided .\n1 .\n\u201c Do as I say , not as I do.\n\u201d While a lot of us grew up in an environment or dynamic in which our parents said one thing and did another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake .\nThe fact of the matter is , that kids pay attention to what we do , more so than they listen to what we say .\nSo , if your child sees you acting in one way , while you are telling them to act in another , chances are , they are going to follow your example .\nIt \u2019 s understandable to be frustrated as a parent , but , when you lose your temper with your child all of the time , they are going to end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantrums .\nNot to mention that when you yell and scream at your kids , it can reach a point in which it becomes emotional abuse , which ultimately will make your child anxious and destroy their self-esteem .\nNot to mention that your child will lose respect for you for acting out .\nYou can make all the rules you want , and you can tell your child over and over not to do something that is considered bad behavior .\nHowever , when there are no consequences , your child isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will continue to engage in bad behavior until you become more consistent and clear about where you stand .\nWith that being said , consequences that involve hitting your child simply don \u2019 t work , according to research .\nNot only that , but they can leave scars on your child emotionally .\nInstead , implement common sense consequences .\nLike , if they draw on the wall , make them clean it up .\nIn modern times , more and more exhausted parents are reaching for devices for a reprieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might not be too terrible ( although studies are showing that tablets , computers , and other screens destroy developmental gray matter , even in small doses ) when you are constantly sitting them in front of a screen , it will destroy their development and cause them to act out .\n5 .\nProject your own goals/ aspirations onto your child .\nMany parents don \u2019 t get to fulfill their dreams and because of that , they push their aspirations and goals on their kids .\nWithout ever asking their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be a doctor or a lawyer .\nAnd while it \u2019 s good to push your kids , it \u2019 s better to encourage them to move towards their own goals based on their talents .\n6 .\nNot expanding your child \u2019 s freedom as they get older .\nAs kids get older , they will reach developmental milestones and in turn , they will begin to crave more freedom .\nNot only do they crave it , but they need it to grow into an adult .\nYou might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch , but the fact of the matter is , that they need more freedom as they grow .\nWe \u2019 ve all been there : the pressure of parenting becomes so much that we are hanging on by a thread , and then , our kid launches a toy at our face .\nWithout even thinking , you begin yelling , or you smack them .\nBut , when you react without processing and managing your own emotions , your child will also do the same .\nAnd ultimately , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when you react out of anger , you are getting dangerously close to unintentionally causing emotional or physical harm .\nAnd you can not undo that .\n8 .\nGiving into their every demand .\nWe all want our kids to be happy .\nAnd there \u2019 s nothing wrong with indulging their desires within reason .\nBut , when you give your child everything they want , without ever making them wait or without using discernment , you are going to end up with an entitled brat .\nWe all get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our top priority .\nNo matter how busy your schedule gets , your children need time with you for their development , to bond with you , to feel secure and of course , they need love .\nDon \u2019 t skimp on quality time .\nYou can do all the things : feed your kids healthy food , make sure they have good rest , and follow all of the best parenting advice , but if you are never consistent , those efforts will be for nothing .\nConsistency is far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel powerless over their lives and the world is a scary place to them .\nIt \u2019 s so easy for them to get overwhelmed , but when you have a consistent bedtime routine , morning routine , eating schedule , and sleeping schedule , you are taking the guesswork out of about 90 % of their lives .\nIn turn , they will feel more secure , and less anxious , and they will be less likely to fight you about the things they do every day .", "author": "Harley Manson",

has begun to shed more light on the effects of certain parenting methods and techniques , we are beginning to understand that a lot of our past tendencies weren \u2019 t exactly the right ones .\nDespite our understanding that our parents didn \u2019 t necessarily have the best methods , a lot of us carry these mistakes with us into our own parenting journeys .\nBefore you get defensive , hear me out .\nYes , despite our parent \u2019 s mistakes , a lot of us did in fact turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if our parents had been equipped with the knowledge of how to not only make us turn out fine but if they had pushed us to become even better ( in a healthy way , of course . )\nAll I am saying is that as we grow and progress as a society , we are learning better ways to handle our children , in order to shape them into productive , empathetic , and whole individuals .\nWhile most of us aspire to be better than our parents , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bad habits with you into your life

have been more easygoing .\nWhile we might not intend to , it \u2019 s easy for us to follow these patterns .\nHowever , it \u2019 s best not to , because studies have shown that this can make things harder for both parent and child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our kids .\nA lot of us grew up with parents who had major dreams and aspirations and who were either unable to accomplish them or accomplished them and wanted their kids to follow in their footsteps .\nActually , just a few decades ago , if a child was raised in a family of lawyers , they were expected to follow that legacy .\nHowever , when you project your own goals , beliefs , etc .\nonto your child , you are completely overlooking the fact that they aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their own gifts , ideas , etc .\nAnd then in some cases , parents may come from a hard upbringing , in which they never had anything or in which their parents weren \u2019 t good to them .\nMuch of the time , parents will overcorrect the bad things from their parents or childhood , by giving into their kids too often and overindulging them .\nYou might think \u201c I never got any toys as a child , so I \u2019 ll never say no to my kid.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ give into their every whim , which is the other extreme , this isn \u2019 t good for them either .\nWhen our parents expect perfection from us , there is a high likelihood that we will expect the same from our kids .\nUnfortunately , this is a really tricky game to be playing , because perfection is not possible .\nYour kids will never feel like anything they do is enough if you expect them to be perfect , because spoiler alert , perfection is impossible .\nLet me say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back : you can not pour from an empty cup .\nIt \u2019 s perfectly fine to want to do everything you can for your kids .\nBut you can \u2019 t give them that if you are constantly stressed and exhausted .\nAs humans , we tend to do what feels natural or comfortable to us .\nAs a parent , you may have sworn not to turn into your mother , but yet here you are yelling at your kids with the same phrases and pitch as your mother did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ?\nOftentimes , we unconsciously recreate themes from our childhood , because it seems familiar .\nIf your parents typically were more closed off and less likely to discuss emotions , you might struggle with avoidance as well .\nIt \u2019 s

won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , consistency is what establishes and places your child in a routine .\nIf you are constantly changing things , your kids will only be confused and unsure of how to react to different situations .\nWhile it \u2019 s great to have big goals for your child , when you set the bar too high , your child is going to be left wondering why they can not reach the expectations held for them .\nEventually , they are going to have confidence issues and low self-esteem , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection isn \u2019 t possible .\nEvery child and situation will be different and there will be circumstances in which you will need to adapt .\nFor example , if something is not working in your parenting routine , yet you continue to do it anyway , you are never going to move past this block .\nIt \u2019 s better to be somewhat flexible , within reason .\nIf you grew up in a strict household , you might be tempted to have a more carefree approach .\nBut , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rules , you are doing a disservice to your child .\nThere are rules and boundaries in the real world , and at the end of the day , your child will eventually enter into that world .\nDo you want them to be equipped to handle it- or do you want them dependent on you ?\nA lack of rules tends to result in the latter , and has also been linked to higher rates of criminality .\nConversely , being too hard on your kids can also reap the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various aspects of life , and it is especially key here .\nEstablish rules and boundaries that your child is realistically capable of .\nFor example , if you have a one-year-old , it \u2019 s highly unlikely that they will be able to clear their plate from the table .\nExpecting them to do so would be an unrealistic expectation and too hard of a rule .\nBe practical in what you expect and if you are confused , check out the developmental milestones/ timelines of what is typically expected of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly common and is what happens when a parent is constantly hovering over their child , watching their every move and allowing them no independence .\nThis can seem like it is an innocent enough tactic , but according to studies , this not only robs your child of their autonomy ( making them dependent on you for life ) but it also makes them far more likely to have anxiety later on and to struggle with decisions and problem-solving .\nIt is one thing to give constructive criticism when it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly nitpick your child \u2019 s every move .\nWhen you are always nit-picking them , they are going to end up extremely self-conscious and anxious .\nPlease note that I don \u2019 t mean physically fighting back , although that is a parenting mistake , but a very obvious one .\nWhat I am talking about is when you are constantly arguing back with your kids .\nWhen you do this , you are placing them in a position of power by allowing them to trigger your emotions .\nInstead of fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies like natural consequences .\n9 .\nRefusal to lead by example .\nYou can tell your child to behave in a certain way or to not behave in a certain way until you are

thought much of the bullying since she \u2019 s been so focused on her dance routines .\n3 .\nEncourage them to ask for help .\nThe first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it happened , no matter how

won \u2019 t be made to .\nWhen your little one is trying to talk to you , listen .\nI suppose the reason why my situation was made easier was that my daughter told me and I listened .\nI assume a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and are brushed off .\nMake sure your child realizes that what is happening is bullying or teasing or whatever the case may be .\nLabel the behavior and encourage them to as well .\n6 .\nCoach them to not react when being teased .\nThe whole reason a bully does what they do is that they want a reaction .\nThey feed off of it .\nRemind your little one that the more they react ( by getting upset , arguing with the bully , etc ) the more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue .\nTell your child when the bully is saying mean things to them to imagine their words hitting them like balls , but bouncing off because they are wearing armor .\nThis might sound strange , and you can honestly word it however you wish , but the gist is to get them to imagine that the words simply bounce off or

and they can also help your little one to do the same .\nInstruct them to put their hand on their tummy , and to breathe in through their nose for three seconds , while their hand rises from their

everyone is a narcissist , and it \u2019 s important to know what the signs are behind true narcissistic manipulation , so you can protect yourself when the time comes .\nNarcissists are individuals who have a personality disorder known as a narcissistic personality disorder .\nTypical symptoms include a grandiose view of themselves ( oftentimes to the point of delusion ) , a lack of empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to take advantage of others , and manipulative behaviors .\nIn relationships , friendships , and family ties , narcissists can be quite abusive .\nAnd when it comes to getting what they want-they will basically do whatever it takes to get what they want .\nIf you \u2019 ve been dealing with someone and are beginning to believe they are trying to manipulate you and that they could be a narcissist , I have listed the clear signs of narcissistic manipulation below .\nEven if you aren \u2019 t currently dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you to decipher what narcissistic manipulation is .\n1 .\nThey are always the victim .\nWhen you first meet the narcissist , they will have you believe that they are the victim of everything and everyone .\nEvery person they \u2019 ve

or \u201c Now I know how you really feel about me \u201d are comments they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no .\nGaslighting is what happens when someone works to make you doubt your own perspective .\nFor example , you may very well witness the narcissist saying one thing to someone and then telling you something else entirely .\nIf you call them out , they will say things like , \u201c Now , you must be crazy I didn \u2019 t say that , \u201d or if you catch them red-handed doing something shady they will act like you are insane for saying so .\nNarcissists will work to diminish your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their behavior , they will act like it \u2019 s no big deal or roll their eyes at you .\nWhen you bring up things that are happening to you , they will say things like , \u201c Well , count yourself as lucky , because you don \u2019 t have it anywhere near as bad as I do.\n\u201d Because narcissists are wired differently , they tend to use love and emotional connections against the people that care about them .\nIf they don \u2019 t get their way , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will use your own emotional needs against you .\nWhen all else fails , the narcissist doesn \u2019 t have any issue with intimidating others .\nThey may bring up something they could use against you , or they may even threaten you with violence .\nIn either case , it \u2019 s best to cut contact with an intimidating narcissist .\nNo matter what the narcissist does to you-they always will find a way to turn the tables on you .\nFor example , if you are dating a narcissist , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore you .\nWhen you tell them that is what they are doing , they will say , \u201c I have to because you won \u2019 t ever let me speak , \u201d or they will act like you are the person in the wrong .\nWhen all else fails , the narcissist will use shame .\nThey are likely to put you down , call you out , or act as though you have disappointed them .\nIt \u2019 s nothing to them to call you out on something you

of this young child , a massive amount nearly cost him his life .\nChubbyemu is a YouTube channel that uses real medical stories for educational purposes .\nHis content takes medical studies and cases and puts them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , he tells a cautionary tale that we should all pay attention to .\nThe patient \u2018 HB \u2019 is only 14 years old and presents to the emergency room in a disoriented state .\nHis mother had taken note of his strange behavior , before finding him laying face down on the living room floor .\nHis mother , Karen had been struggling with HB \u2019 s behavior , as she had recently gone through a divorce after her husband had left .\nHB was very loud , screaming and yelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eat tons of candy , which she blamed for his bad behavior .\nThis pushed her to come up with an idea .\nShe purchased melatonin gummies and replaced his regular gummies with melatonin gummies .\nIt seemed harmless enough .\nHowever , when he began to eat the gummies , he noticed they tasted pretty good and continued to eat a massive amount .\nHe consumed the entire bag of 180 gummy melatonins for lunch .\nHe began to feel dizzy and strange and passed out .\nKaren immediately took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t tell them what she had done .\nFinally , after a while , as the doctors prepared to begin blood tests , she told the doctor he may have accidentally consumed 180 gummy melatonins .\nImmediately , the doctors understood what was happening .\nAccording to Chubbyemu , the poison control center is receiving more and more calls about children who have been given too much melatonin .\nIt has become quite common for parents to give their kids far too much melatonin .\nWhy ?\nWell , your guess is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming it \u2019 s because people believe that it \u2019 s completely safe .\nHowever , at least two children have died in the past ten years from a megadose of melatonin .\nAs Chubbyemu points out , melatonin is metabolized by the liver .\nSo , if you are taking other medications that are metabolized the same way , it can cause your other medication to be less effective or could cause toxicity in your blood because the liver only has so many cells for metabolizing .\nThankfully , for HB that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated Karen and HB about how while there was no immediate illness caused by the melatonin , it could cause issues for him later on , especially regarding his hormones and hormonal balance .\nThey advised that he might be sleepy for several days , and to take it easy .\nBecause he didn \u2019 t return , he likely made a full recovery .\nOne major takeaway is this : Melatonin is a hormone , and an active one .\nIntroducing excess melatonin into the unnecessary body can disrupt your child

important to teach our kids empathy , it \u2019 s important to differentiate between immature and mature forms of empathy , so we can ensure we are shaping our kids to become emotionally mature individuals .\nYou might be scratching your head because the topic of mature versus immature empathy is not a prevalent discussion .\nI mean , empathy is empathy , right ?\nWell , not so much .\nWhile there are different styles of empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a wrong way to empathize with others .\nWhen you think about it , immature empathy might come from the right place , it is just delivered in the wrong way .\nOftentimes , we continue with the same habits and methods our parents treated us with .\nHowever , it \u2019 s always a good time to break free from generational curses and do better than the previous generations .\nHere are four immature styles of empathy , and one mature form .\nThe first four are what we shouldn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should do .\nIgnoring is what happens when we ignore the fact that our child is upset and only worry about their behavior .\nFor example , when your child comes to you upset because their favorite toy is broken , and instead of soothing them , you immediately get onto them for breaking their toy .\nSaving is what happens when instead of helping our children cope with their emotions , we try to save them from them .\nAs an example , if your child is upset if instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their emotions , you instead focus on ridding them of all negative emotions , this is referred to as saving .\nWhen your child comes to you because they are upset about a rule at school if instead of helping them to understand the rule you move them to a different school , you are teaching them that emotions should be avoided at all costs if they are difficult .\nThe problem is , they never learn to handle their emotions .\nA lot of us experienced this growing up .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having negative emotions .\nAn example of this is \u201c Stop crying or I \u2019 ll give you something to cry about !\n\u201d or \u201c Hush or I am going to put you in time out !\n\u201d Ultimately , what this teaches them is that their emotions are bad and to repress them .\nAdditionally , they too will shut people down for having emotions , because they will learn to empathize with punishment .\nDismissing is a form of emotional invalidation .\nWhen your child comes to you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Oh , it \u2019 s not that bad !\n\u201d you are dismissing their emotions .\nIt might not seem like a big deal to you , but what you are doing is telling your child that their feelings don \u2019 t matter or that they are too sensitive and should harden up .\nUltimately , this can shape your child to also empathize with others through dismissal .\nCoaching is the only healthy way to empathize with your child .\nWhen you sit down with them and work to understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without judgment , you can change your child \u2019 s world .\nWe are our kid \u2019 s emotional coaches .\nThey need us to help them .\nWhen they come to us , no matter how frustrating they are acting because they are upset , and no matter how

always been interesting to me that while most of us acknowledge that lying in a relationship is bad , many of us withhold how we truly feel .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasons .\nIt might be to avoid conflict , or it could even be because we are afraid they may not feel the same way .\nRegardless of why , I am a firm believer that transparency is the best policy .\nHere are 7 reasons why : A lot of us do not trust our partners , and a lot of this is because when they say they feel one way , they typically feel another .\nThis can make it hard to trust- because you never know if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are saying is genuine .\nHave you ever met a couple that never communicated ?\nIf you haven \u2019 t , let me paint you a picture : there are constant miscommunications and misunderstandings , there are a lot of wild assumptions- and the two are almost never on the same page .\nIt \u2019 s so easy to just be honest .\nIt might not seem that way , but once you start , it gets easier .\n3 .\nYou never have to guess where you stand .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never read , then you already know how confusing that can be .\nWhile this person may claim they want a commitment , on the other hand , they aren \u2019 t ready .\nInstead of saying that-they avoid doing so to avoid conflict .\nUltimately , later on , the foundation of the relationship falls apart .\nIf you are open and honest , to begin with-this doesn \u2019 t happen .\n4 .\nYou can work on the problems that are present .\nThere will always be problems in relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two very independent wills , so there is going to be a clash from time to time .\nIf you burrow how you feel- it might save you from a fight now , but it doesn \u2019 t solve the issue .\nBoundaries are necessary for all relationships .\nWhile you might not want to express a boundary or a limit- if your heart is telling you and you don \u2019 t , you are doing yourself and your partner a major disservice .\nIn relationships , we play so many games when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might try to passively aggressively communicate how we feel , or we might try to send \u2018 signals.\n\u2019 Why not just put it all on the table ?\nUltimately , your partner deserves the respect of knowing where you stand with them and how you feel .\nEveryone wants to be clued into their partner \u2019 s emotional state .\nYou don \u2019 t have to tell them every thought that crosses your mind- but if something is bothering you , fess up .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

mistakes are not only inevitable , but most of them are slight .\nHowever , some common mistakes can cause great harm to your children , without you ever meaning to .\nSome of these are pretty common

correct and keep moving forward along the way to raising happy and healthy kids .\n1 .\nPraising everything they do .\nIt might seem like a good idea to praise your child constantly , but when you do , you are only setting them up to expect to be praised for existing .\nInstead of praising them all the time , praise them for their efforts and their accomplishments .\n2 .\nGiving them everything they want .\nWhen your child is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new toy , it might be tempting to just give in .\nHowever , if you do this regularly , you are only harming your child- because you are teaching them they are entitled to get what they want , even if it isn \u2019 t what they need or deserve .\nThis works both ways .\nKids need to have boundaries with their parents , and their parents need to have boundaries with them .\nThis means not sharing adult problems with your kids , who are unable to process them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child to set reasonable boundaries with you and respect them .\n4 .\nNot modeling the behavior you want to see .\nYou can preach all day about how you want your child to act- but if you are acting the opposite , they are going to do as they see , not as you say .\nThe thing is- even if your child didn \u2019 t want to be anything like you-they are unintentionally picking up habits and behaviors from you all the time .\nThe world is so chaotic to @ @ @ @ @ @

Parenting .\nThis framework she has built works to help parents move through more positive parenting by replacing rewards and punishment with emotional regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather than punishing a child for having difficult emotions , this form of discipline works to help both parent and child to understand their emotions and feelings , so problem-solving can be tackled as a team .\nTo do this , parents are supposed to emotionally coach their kids , teaching them how to acknowledge their emotions , so they can understand how they are reacting to them and how they should react to them .\nWhen speaking with Fatherly HQ , Durrant explained that an example of this is when your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore your child , you could spank them , or you could put them in the corner .\nHowever , none of these addresses the issue .\nInstead of being punished , you can help your child learn how to understand and regulate their emotions .\nInstead of punishing them , Durrant suggests calming down ( regulating your own emotions ) and then sitting down with your child and showing them how to do the same .\nMake emotional discussions an open conversation in your home , and make emotional coaching the focal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are new to this approach , Durrant offers a suggestion .\n\u201c If I want my child to be empathic , then I need to help them understand other people \u2019

"content": "As parents , a major part of our job is to ensure that we communicate with our children about safety .\nWhile it may be an uncomfortable topic- communication about body safety can make a huge difference to your baby \u2019 s well-being .\nIt might seem like a tricky subject because there is a fine line between empowering your child and terrifying them .\nWhile you don \u2019 t want them to be afraid of every person they see , you also don \u2019 t want them to be taken advantage of by the wrong person .\nAnd if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe , because you monitor everyone they are around , please understand that oftentimes , abusers can be those closest to you and even other kids .\nPrevention begins in the home .\nBelow , I have provided five meaningful ways you can teach your child about safe and unsafe touch .\n1 .\nTalk to them at home , in a peaceful moment and environment .\nDiscussing body safety can be a scary topic to breach , so when you approach the topic , make sure that the circumstances are peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heat of the moment , or when you \u2019 ve gotten upset and are emotional .\nMake sure to do it from a calm and collected place , choose your words carefully and listen while being attentive to your child .\nExplain what safe and unsafe touches are and how they look in reality .\nUse examples and invite them to compare too .\nFor example , unsafe touch would be if someone asks you not to tell anyone , if they force you to touch them , or if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safe touch would be a hug from someone they trust or a doctor \u2019 s examination .\n3 .\nEmpower them to be in charge of their own body .\nLet them be in charge of their own body .\nIf they do not want to be hugged , allow them to set that boundary .\nMake sure they understand that it \u2019 s not okay for someone else to touch them in any way that they do not like .\nAn example might be if a friend was jumping up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the person to stop .\nMake sure that your child understands body safety rules .\nRules would include things like : it \u2019 s never okay for someone to touch your private parts , it \u2019 s never okay for someone to take pictures of them with their clothes off , and it \u2019 s never okay for people to show them videos of people without clothes .\nThere are many different body safety rules to consider , but discussing as many as you can think of in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 .\nExplain that unsafe touch should NEVER be a secret .\nAbove all remind them that unsafe touching should never be a secret .\nHonestly , I would encourage them to not keep secrets from you at all .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/5-ways-to-teach-your-child-about-safe-unsafe-touch/",

defining moments are in the small every day things we do for our kids .\nLooking back at even my childhood , I can see that the small , sweet moments I shared with my mother meant far more to me than everything else .\nAs a parent now , I have thought a lot about those small efforts my mother made , and have strived to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments for my little ones .\nIf you are like me and want to be the best parent you can be , I implore you to carry out these tasks .\nNone of them require a ton of money or even a ton of time .\nIn the modern world , it has become so acceptable to stay tuned in to social media , our smartphones , and what is going on in the modern world , that many of us are constantly distracted .\nIf you take one look around you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really scary picture manifests : everyone is glued to their phones , and for parents , this is especially scary to me .\nKids need your attention , your focus , and your presence .\nNot only for their development but also for their emotional well-being .\nSo , stow away the electronics and make quality time a priority .\nYou don \u2019 t have to be perfect , but you do need to make sure that your behaviors are consistent with what you are expecting from your child .\nFor example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after themselves , but here you are , leaving things scattered about- you aren \u2019 t practicing what you preach .\nAnd ultimately , your kids are going to do as they see , not as you say .\nWhen your child is upset and beginning to act out it \u2019 s easy to get frustrated and lose your cool .\nHowever , it \u2019 s much better to slow down , take a deep breath and pay attention to why they are acting the way that they are .\nBe empathetic .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ child do whatever they want- kids need limits .\nBut as their parent , you need to understand where they are coming from .\nLooking back at my childhood , some of the best moments were moments of laughter and fun with my mom .\nLittle trips to the drive-in in the middle of the night , goofy dances with Hoola hoops , and inside jokes only my mom and sister would understand are the things that stick out most in my mind .\nBe sure to make real memories with your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to punish .\nWe often use the words \u2018 discipline \u2019 and \u2018 punish \u2019 interchangeably , but they are not the same .\nTo discipline is to teach or instill value while punishing is just that .\nWhile punishment might be a form of discipline , it is not the most effective .\nThe most effective comes through teaching your child the right and wrong way to do things .\nIt \u2019 s easy to get caught up in your emotions and just let them rule over you .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more calculated than that .\nWe all make mistakes , but strive to use words that empower not words that belittle .\nRoutines and rituals will often be remembered because they become a part of who we are .\nMake sure to develop these routines with your kids .\nBedtime is especially important because good rest is essential to your child \u2019 s growth and development .\nSo , make bedtime a moment they can unwind , snuggle in , and share a precious moment with you .\nFor some , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in affectionate families .\nBut , if you struggle with this- it is important to seek out help .\nYour kids need little hugs , cuddles , and to be held

who were raised by a strong mother , her influence helped us to grow in more ways than one .\nGrowing up , I always knew my mother was cut from a different cloth .\nShe has always been strong , never backing down from anything .\nFor every obstacle life threw her-she always got the last punch .\nAt the time , I didn \u2019 t always appreciate her strength .\nI admired it , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be intimidating .\n\u201c Will I be able to fill those shoes ?\n\u201d you may ask yourself .\nI am glad to say that while no one will ever be the woman my mother is- her influence helped me to become

me to never blindly follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother down , she got back up and tried again .\nEvery obstacle that was meant to break her only made her stronger .\nAnd I pray to God that I always follow in her footsteps .\n5 .\nNever become dependent on anyone .\nIt \u2019 s okay to let your guard down and to love , but always , always have the plan to save yourself if you must .\nMy mother always knew her next move , and she made something of herself without a lot of guidance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always kind to others unless they give her a reason not to be .\nShe would go out of her way to do something nice for someone else .\nShe was always considerate and was always volunteering her time to do the right thing when others would not .\n7 .\nStand up for those who can not defend themselves .\nWhen I was in school , I remember a little boy who was developmentally disabled getting beat up .\nNo teachers would do anything about it- because they were all friends with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother encouraged me to take up for him if I witnessed it again .\nAnd I did .\nThe bullies kept kicking the boy in his arm , and groin , and I did the same to the bullies as they walked by .\nThe teacher actually began scolding ME- even though I was defending that boy .\nIt just so happened that my mom was walking up to pick me up from school , and she witnessed nearly all of it- including the teacher telling me I should NEVER get in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong .\nMy mom told the teacher that I was ALWAYS allowed to take up for kids that were being bullied .\nSay what you will- but that lesson has always stuck in my mind .\n8 .\nTreat people the way you want to be treated .\nThe Golden rule was a big thing in our house .\nI remember grumbling because I wanted to treat people how they treated me- but my mom was right .\nYou should never compromise your personal values because other people are assholes .\n9 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ others .\nAbove all , no matter how much flack my mom would receive-she never folded on her beliefs .\nShe always stands up for what she knows in her heart .\nAnd thank God for that .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

I \u2019 ll tell you how to stop it and how to begin repairing your marriage .\nSo , let \u2019 s dive into the first sign to look for\u2026 Sign # 1 \u2013 Arguing Over Anything & Everything .\nYes , it \u2019 s no secret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arguments with your partner are a clear indication that all is not well with your marriage .\nNow , don \u2019 t panic here just because you and your spouse are fighting a few times a week\u2026 every married couple will disagree and have conflicts from time to time , and it \u2019 s actually a healthy thing to argue now and then as long as they lead to resolutions or don \u2019 t leave lingering hard feelings .\nWhen those arguments become daily occurrences , and tend to arise over almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things get a bit more dicey .\nFor example , if you arriving 5 minutes late for a dinner date turns into a massive screaming match and results in both of you going to bed angry for the third time in a week , then that \u2019 s a problem .\nThese kinds of arguments , if they happen frequently and tend to blow small grievances or disagreements way out of proportion , can indicate that your marriage is headed in the wrong direction .\nMost of the time , couples who argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can repair this problem relatively easily .\nIn simple terms , if you and your spouse fight too much or argue often over small issues , you need to learn how to prevent the useless arguments and have more important disagreements in a more civilized and constructive manner .\nClick here to watch an excellent free video with tips on how to argue more

.\nWhich leads me to the next point\u2026 .\nSign # 2 \u2013 No Longer Willing To Resolve Conflict or Find Solutions .\nIf your partner seems to no longer care about the outcome of a fight , or if they seem to feel as though trying to find a solution to your problems is pointless or hopeless , then that can be a clear indication of deeper troubles .\nWhen this kind of despair sets in , your partner may withdraw further and feel as though there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you to live together in peace .\nThat \u2019 s obviously not a good thing , and it \u2019 s something that you need to work on if this has become a problem in your marriage .\nSign # 3 \u2013 Lack of Emotional Connection and Withdrawal of Affection .\nIf your wife has become distant and stopped showing affection towards you , that can also be a strong indication that they \u2019 re mentally checking out of the marriage .\nOften associated with this is an overall lack of emotional connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or show feelings and emotions .\nIn my experience , this is one of the most obvious signs that a marriage is headed in the wrong direction .\nUsually , though , it \u2019 s more a symptom than a root problem

\u2019 s no emotional connection , the sex is going to disappear as well .\nBut it can also be a problem of its own and lead to a marriage crisis , whether it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low sex drive .\nEither way , a sexless marriage is almost always a marriage on the fast track to divorce , so if your spouse seems uninterested in sex or makes excuses , that \u2019 s a clear indication of problems .\nSign # 5 \u2013 Your spouse is absent more often or seems pre-occupied .\nIf your partner is staying out late more often , and showing less interest in family and spending time together , that may be an indication that they are either unhappy with the situation at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re preparing mentally for life apart , building a social life or possibly even dating .\nHopefully that \u2019 s not the case , and don \u2019 t prematurely accuse your spouse of this just because they \u2019 re home less often , but it is a possibility .\nSimply put , if you \u2019 re spending less time with your wife than you have in the past or if she seems distant and pre-occupied when you are spending time together , that can be a clear sign of a spouse mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage .\nNext Steps : Where to go from here\u2026 First , let \u2019 s make one thing clear : just because your partner is exhibiting a couple of the behaviors that I just talked about doesn \u2019 t mean that they \u2019 re definitely planning to file for divorce .\nIt may simply be that these are indicators of trouble ahead in your marriage .\nBut if you \u2019 ve seen several of these

parent or if mother nature decides for you , people will inevitably ask you stupid questions until the day you die .\nThat might sound harsh , but hear me out .\nDuring my 20s , as a newly married individual , I began trying to have babies .\nUnfortunately , things did not pan out for me , and by the time I reached 30 , I had personally given up .\nAfter years of not having any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which I was a parent .\nIt just simply wasn \u2019 t in the cards for me , and I came to terms with that .\nHowever , no matter how secure I am with it , I still get those uncomfortable questions ,

come on , you have to know that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic to be asking about .\nBut , I digress .\nHere are the 9 most annoying things people have said to me as a childfree adult .\n1 .\nWhy don \u2019 t you have any kids ?\nThis is such a presumptuous question , because first of all , what makes you think this is any of your business ?\nIt irks my nerves because , at one point in my life , this question shattered me .\nWhenever someone would ask this when I was actively trying , I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what is going on in the lives of others , and unless they choose to clue you in , don \u2019 t ask this question .\n2 .\nYou \u2019 re going to change your mind one day and it \u2019 ll be too late .\nOh , the old ticking time bomb uterus statement .\nThis one is used quite often by those who can not see meaning in life without children .\nI \u2019 ve heard it so many times , and I have to say that while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s super annoying .\n3 .\nYou know they have procedures for that , right ?\nThere again , a lot of people assume they know the secret key that is going to save you once and for all .\nYes , I understand there are procedures and treatments and honestly , I don \u2019 t want them .\nMost of us that do want them , go get them , and the vast majority of childless parents that want children are trying their best to have kids .\nPutting extra pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n4 .\nBut who will take care of you when you are old ?\nFirst of all , I need to know who has kids , just so they can be taken care of when they are old .\nThat seems like a lot of weight to put on the shoulders of a baby .\nIf I had a baby , it would be because I wanted a baby , not a future caregiver .\n5 .\nYou aren \u2019 t too old , yet .\nYet another that I hear so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids ?\n\u201d they ask , \u201c No , \u201d I respond , and then they say , \u201c You aren \u2019 t too old , yet.\n\u201d I \u2019 m well aware of my age , and that still isn \u2019 t changing my mind , Becky , okay ?\nJust because someone could be a loving mother does not mean that she wants to be one .\nI think that is the part that some people don \u2019 t get-that just because you \u2019 d be good at something , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be nice to have all that free time .\nI \u2019 ve always thought that it \u2019 s interesting that people who have kids think that parenting is the only adult responsibility in the world .\nSo , we childless adults must have all the time in the world .\nI \u2019 d like to enlighten the world that many things fill up the time of child-free adults .\nMany of us have full-time careers , responsibilities in our homes , with our partners , tons of cleaning to do , fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll happen for you , one day .\nOnce again , I understand that the intention is genuine here .\nHowever , the thing is , a lot of people who have children assume that if you are child-free , it \u2019 s not by choice .\nI tend to instantly correct people on this assumption , but it does get to be annoying to repeat the same thing over and over again .\n9 .\nYou aren \u2019 t a parent , so you don \u2019 t get it .\nJust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t mean they don \u2019 t understand the job .\nI 100 % understand kids .\nI have had kids in my life .\nYou do not have to be a parent to know what the job entails and to understand kids .", "author":

By Parents Who Do These 9 Things", "content": "As parents , we are a massive influence over who our children grow up to be .\nThankfully , this can work in our favor and in theirs- because there are many ways we can help shape them into compassionate , empathetic , and kind individuals .\nEmpathy is a skill , much like anything else , and is something that our children develop with our help .\nIn a world where people are becoming increasingly selfish , entitled , and even hostile- it \u2019 s important to ensure that we are setting our children up to be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but compassion is a necessary trait for your child to build lasting and meaningful connections with others .\nHere are 9 things you can do to raise a compassionate kid .\nIn order for children to understand someone else \u2019 s perspective , it \u2019 s important to help them understand how others feel .\nYou can do this by observing the facial expressions of others and explaining what they mean .\nWhen someone is being rude , and you observe it , make sure you point it out appropriately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go out to eat and the hostess is rude to you \u2013 when you \u2019 ve walked away , say , \u201c That hostess must be having a bad day to have been so meaningful to us .\nWhat are your thoughts ?\n\u201d By pointing out unsavory behavior , you are setting the stage for your child to grow into a more compassionate person .\n3 .\nAcknowledge when they are kind .\nWhen your child is kind , praise them .\nAnd when others are kind to you and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this .\nFor example , if a man helps you to take your groceries out to your car at the supermarket , say , \u201c Thank you so much for your kind gesture .\nIsn \u2019 t that kind of him to help us ?\n\u201d There is a saying that goes something like , \u201c Be the change you wish to see , \u201d and when it comes to kids- this couldn \u2019 t be any more true .\nYou can preach compassion all day long- but if you don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts will be in vain .\nIf you want a compassionate kid- you are going to need to be compassionate , too .\nKids deserve respect just like anyone else .\nThe thing about respect is that unless you treat your kids with respect , they are not going to learn what respect is and how to treat others with respect .\nMuch like the above note to model compassion , you also need to model respect , because the two go hand in hand .\nGratitude is so important .\n\u201c When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be generous and helpful in the future , \u201d says Sabrina Romanoff , PsyD , a Harvard-trained psychologist , and parenting expert .\nHer recommendation is to set up regular opportunities to model gratitude , like going around the dinner table and everyone saying what they are grateful for .\nAs your child grows , make sure you constantly work to help them understand feelings and words .\nWhen you notice them sad , or others sad , emphasize that is sadness .\nCover anger , sadness , happiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on and so forth .\nThe more words you use to describe feelings , the more equipped your child will be to understand those emotions .\n8 .\nRaise your child to be aware .\nIt might seem tempting to paint the world in a rose-colored light , but to do so will rob your child of an opportunity to learn real compassion .\nWhile you don \u2019 t need to get into horrific or gory details about the goings on of the world , it is beneficial to shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c When you expose children to the sufferings of others , they end up feeling grateful for what they have and proud of being able to help someone , \u201d says Dr. Christine Carter .\nIf you want to raise a child with internalized kindness , make sure that you explain why you do certain things for others .\n\u201c [ Kids need to ] understand why parents do what they do and what it means to them .\nParents should say : \u2018 I feel good when I can contribute.\n\u2019 \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kindness Advantage .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/compassionate-kids-are-raised-by-parents-who-do-these-9-things/",

your values , set a good example for your daughter , and make sure that you teach her the following things to prepare her for womanhood .\n1 .\nStand up for what you believe in .\nAlways remind your daughter that she has a voice and that if she believes in something , she should stand by her beliefs , and not allow others to take her voice away .\nToo often , young women are raised to be people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing back on their own beliefs and opinions to make others happy .\nMake sure your daughter knows that standing firm on what she believes is more important than pleasing others .\n2 .\nHave respect for yourself , first and foremost .\nSo many young girls are being taught that their body is their worth .\nThey see musicians and Instagram models who have absolutely no respect for themselves and they think that is what they need to be like to be accepted .\nIn turn , many let their boyfriends degrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deserve better- because they don \u2019 t understand self-respect .\nTeach your daughter to respect herself and to always demand the respect that she deserves from others .\n3 .\nThe importance of having good friends .\nAs parents , it \u2019 s our job to teach our children social skills .\nWhile much of this is done by having a healthy relationship with your child- it \u2019 s important to emphasize the value of a good friend or a group of good friends .\n4 .\nYour value is much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a female , there is so much emphasis put on how we look and there is immense pressure to be perceived as hot or beautiful .\nUnfortunately , society \u2019 s standards of beauty are unrealistic .\nInstagram models who have photoshopped themselves beyond recognition post images online , and little girls see that and wonder why they don \u2019 t look like that .\nThey don \u2019 t realize that nobody really looks like that .\nHowever , the thing is- a woman \u2019 s value is so much deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is on the inside that matters ( not to sound clich\u00e9 \u2019 ) .\n5 .\nLife is full of choices , don \u2019 t let society hold you back .\nJust because something isn \u2019 t traditionally a female path , does not mean that your child should feel limited .\nFor example , if your daughter wants to be a mechanic , a welder or whatever the case may be , make sure she knows that she can do whatever she puts her mind to .\n6 .\nFinding love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When kids first start exploring the realm of dating and connecting with the opposite sex , unless we talk to them openly and honestly , they are going to get their information from other kids .\nMuch like the blind leading the blind- it \u2019 s likely they are going to accept things that are not necessarily true .\nYoung girls are pressured so much by young boys to have sex , otherwise they are called a prude .\nTeach your daughter that sex should be the product of love , not vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than lust .\n7 .\nMen are different from us and that is okay .\nIt will help to put things into perspective if you explain to your daughter that men and women are different .\nContrary to what many would have you believe-there are science backed differences between women and men , and it \u2019 s those differences that provide balance in the universe .\nExplain the differences between masculine and feminine , and why each of us have different strengths and weaknesses .\n8 .\nYou don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy-work on you first .\nRemind your daughter that it \u2019 s perfectly okay to be single and to work on building yourself up , before worrying about dating .\nWhile it \u2019 s okay to have a partner , to get married and all of that- it \u2019 s also okay to be single until you figure everything else out .\nLet her know there \u2019 s no pressure to rush .\nLastly , please let your daughter know that perfection does not exist .\nWhile we should always strive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection , because if it is- you are setting yourself up for failure .\nTeach her the importance of doing her best and that mistakes and failure happen , but that there is always room to start over .", "author": "Harley Manson",

a firm supporter of the school of thought that says that you should most definitely apologize to your kids when you have done wrong .\nThere are so many reasons why this is beneficial , however , there are also times when you should NOT apologize to your child .\nFirst and foremost , if you have done something wrong , it \u2019 s so important to suck it up and own your mistake .\nWhen you do ,

right and a wrong time to apologize to your child .\nHere are 4 times you should NOT apologize : 1 .\nWhen your child is upset because they didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children can sometimes become distressed because things are not the way they want or expect them to be .\nFor example , if you don \u2019 t cut the crust perfectly from their sandwich , and they begin throwing a tantrum , it \u2019 s a terrible time to apologize .\nWhy ?\nWhen you apologize , you are sending the message to your child that they have been wronged , because you didn \u2019 t give them exactly what they wanted .\nUltimately , this will hinder your child from being flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better when something happens they don \u2019 t like .\nThis isn \u2019 t the way the world works .\n2 .\nWhen you did not cross a line .\nIt \u2019 s good to apologize when you have gone too far .\nFor example , if you yelled and screamed at your child , it is good to say that you are sorry for how you reacted .\nBut , if you simply got onto your child for doing something they shouldn \u2019 t have been doing , and you didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you do , you are sending the message that you are in the wrong any time you reprimand them .\n3 .\nWhen your child is being unreasonable .\nIf you are in the store and your child wants the most expensive toy , and you say no , and they commence throwing a tantrum , crying , or sulling up , you may be tempted to say , \u201c I \u2019 m sorry.\n\u201d Or apologize for not giving in to their demands .\nInstead , you should stand by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not within your capability to give them what they want .\n4 .\nWhen it \u2019 s not your place to apologize .\nWhen someone disappoints your child , you may be tempted to apologize on behalf of that person .\nHowever , it is not your place or responsibility to apologize for someone else \u2019 s actions .\nIt \u2019 s perfectly normal to sympathize and empathize with your child and be there for them .\nBut , it \u2019 s necessary to let go of the need to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s not your place .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

they can have a real childhood .\nMost of the time , teenagers believe they are much more grown than they are .\nIn their minds , they should be allowed to make their own choices , and we should allow them the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s okay to allow your teen more freedom as they get older .\nBut , be careful not to allow them to take on too much too early .\nBelow , I will list 10 things that teenagers do , but shouldn \u2019 t .\nWatch any teen movie , and it becomes abundantly clear that our society normalizes teen drinking .\nHowever , lest we forget that alcohol is a drug .\nWhile your teen may just pick it up during social settings , it is far too easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or lead to your child getting in an accident or doing dangerous things they should not be doing .\nNot all teens will experiment with drugs , but the vast majority of them will try at least one substance before they finish high school .\nNowadays , it has become prevalent for teens to misuse prescriptions like Adderall or cough medicine .\nIn most cases , they will simply try marijuana , but remember , their brains are developing still .\nAnd any chemical that changes their state of mind is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe all laugh it off when teenagers live off of pizza rolls , burgers , and fries , but these foods should not be the center of anyone \u2019 s diet .\nYes , it \u2019 s okay to enjoy some junk , but there is a need for balance .\nYour child needs nutrients , including vitamins and minerals , that are only available in certain healthy foods .\nThe National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy say that 20 % of teens are sending nude photos of themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSociety teaches our young girls that it \u2019 s a form of flattery to be asked for a nude photo-however , it \u2019 s important to teach your daughter that a boy who respects them would never ask for that .\nEnergy drinks come in fun flavors , and attention-grabbing colors and are marketed as \u2018 gaming fuel \u2019 or even \u2018 studying fuel \u2019 however , these drinks are loaded with massive amounts of caffeine .\nSome include twice the amount that is healthy , in addition to a load of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death .\nAt the very least , drinking a ton of caffeine could cause damage to their heart , or prevent them from getting the right amount of sleep .\nIf combined with alcohol- a whole other host of problems can arise .\nSocial media has become a normal part of our society and is used by teens to connect .\nHowever , when your teen begins making secret accounts and refusing to accept your friend request , it \u2019 s time to draw a line .\nRemember , while you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earn that right , and making secret accounts and refusing to keep you in the know should be a no-go .\nMost teenagers , no matter how informed they may be about condom usage and birth control , will not use those things properly or even at all .\nSex comes with obvious risks , like pregnancy , and STDS , some of which are irreversible .\nLet it be known that even birth control can not 100 % guarantee the prevention of conception .\nAnd what happens from there will be @ @ @ @ @ @

permanently disabled .\nPlease remind them to stow their phone away until they are safely parked .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow their teens to use tanning beds .\nEven when I was a teen , I could not understand it- because it comes with many risks .\nThe worst case scenario is skin cancer , and if they are spared from that outcome , they are going to have skin damage that they will regret later on .\nIt used to be common knowledge that smoking and nicotine use is deadly .\nBut , since the tobacco companies found a way to wrap the drug nicotine ( and it is very much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy and

@ @ @ @ already made plans , and he calls you last minute-when you say , \u201c Okay , sure .\nI \u2019 ll cancel my plans , \u201d it only makes you look like you lack self-respect and respect for

makes it seem like you are desperate .\nAny decent person will want to take their time and build something organically .\n3 .\nHaving sex before you are ready .\nThe pressure to have sex with someone almost immediately is so high .\nIn movies , we see people having sex on the first date and think if we don \u2019 t do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy .\nNot even just that , but making him wait is a surefire way of testing his intentions .\nIf he doesn \u2019 t want you because you wouldn \u2019 t have sex sooner than you were comfortable with-his intentions weren \u2019 t good .\n4 .\nSaying yes to everything .\nWhen you want to make someone happy , out of fear of losing them , it can be tempting to say yes every time they ask us to go somewhere or do something .\nThe thing is though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and establish boundaries .\nThere is absolutely no way you can say yes to everything \u2013 and that is perfectly okay .\nHe will respect you a lot more if you are open about what you can and can not do .\n5 .\nInvest more time in the connection than he does .\nAnother misconception in our society is that women are the ones who put more effort into a relationship .\nWe often see girls calling back to back , chasing after the guy , and doing everything to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort in than he does , the balance in the relationship gets skewed .\nIf you are putting in more effort

hits you , or continues to disrespect your boundaries-don \u2019 t give him a second chance .\nI \u2019 m not saying that people don \u2019 t change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep down , you know if he \u2019

the teasing is uncomfortable- that it is nothing beyond what they can handle .\nThis will help them to cope in the long run when situations like this arise again .\n2 .\nTell them if at all possible to ignore it .\nIf the person or people teasing them is just making rude remarks , encourage them to ignore it and to keep doing whatever they are doing .\nThe bully wants a reaction , and if they don

that if they are being bullied for their glasses , tell them to respond , \u201c Thanks for noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s their braces , \u201c Thanks for noticing my teeth , \u201d for almost any scenario , there is a way to reframe .\nAnother good tactic is to teach them visualization .\nWhen the bully is saying mean things , tell them to imagine their words hitting them and imagine a shield

lot.\n\u201d Oftentimes agreeing with the facts will help them to eliminate feelings of fear associated with the bullying .\nAs my mother used to say , kill \u2019 em with kindness .\nThere is nothing

time-out is necessary or another form of punishment .\nHowever , what I never expected was for my son to shrug off my attempts to discipline him .\nIn most cases , parents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stubborn or bad .\nInstead of them being impacted by the punishment , they just smile and act like it \u2019 s not a big deal .\nWhile for some parents , this may push them to think that more punishment or harsher punishment is necessary , that actually will likely do more harm than good .\nFor quite a while now , both psychologists and pediatricians alike have agreed that strict and harsh

action .\nExamples of this are if they go outside without a jacket after you told them to put one on , they are stuck feeling cold .\nIf they go to bed late , they are tired throughout their day .\nIf

.\nFor example , you are grounded until you stop getting in trouble in class for talking over the teacher .\n5 .\nFocus on discipline , rather than just punishment .\nDiscipline and punishment are words used interchangeably , but shouldn \u2019 t be .\nDiscipline is teaching your child how to behave correctly and while punishment is often a means to do this , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to

them good manners is especially important .\nNot only will it ensure that you are sending a good human into the world , but it will also help them to forge healthy social relationships with others .\nWith that said , here are 10 good manners you need to teach your kids .\nIt is so rude to interrupt someone who is speaking .\nWhat you are saying when you talk over someone is that what they are saying is not important .\nIf your child interrupts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbally interrupting , they need you to place a hand on your arm .\nAny time they forget , remind them , and go back to your conversation .\n2 .\nTo say please and thank you .\nWhile saying please and thank you should be common sense , if you take a stroll around in any public place , you will soon realize that is not the case .\nTeach your child to say please if they are asking for something , and to say thank you when they are receiving something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere are multiple reasons to say excuse me .\nFor example , if someone is talking to your child if they need to walk away , teach them to excuse themselves from the conversation and go do what they need to do .\nAdditionally , if they bump into someone or are in someone \u2019 s way , teach them to say excuse me .\nWhen your child is invited over to someone \u2019 s house , remind them to be on their best behavior .\nTeach them to throw away their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make up their sleeping area , and to offer to help as needed .\nAlso , tell them to say thank you when they are invited somewhere .\nA good guest gets invited back , but not only that- it \u2019 s just the right thing to do .\nThere are a few basic table manners all kids should be taught .\nThis includes not talking while they are chewing up food ( not just because of manners , but because it \u2019 s a choking hazard . )\nAlso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching them to wipe their mouths is good practice .\nAnd of course , if they need to leave the table to say \u201c Excuse me.\n\u201d 6 .\nTo acknowledge someone who is speaking to them .\nWhen someone is speaking to your child , teach them to acknowledge the person speaking to them .\nFor example , if they are asked a question , they should either answer it or say why they do not want to answer it .\nIt \u2019 s just rude to ignore others .\n7 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child makes a mess , teach them that it is good manners to clean it up .\nWhen they leave the table , if it \u2019 s age-appropriate , they need to learn to clear their place .\nIf they eat candy , teach them to throw away their trash .\nAnd if they make a mess-show them how to clean it up or teach them to alert someone else if they can not .\n8 .\nWhen not to speak .\nThere are times when speaking is not appropriate .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainer has taken the stage , at a funeral when the service is being conducted , or when they have the urge to say something that is not nice .\nTeach your child about shaking hands when they are younger , so that when they grow up they will have that knowledge .\nWhen they meet new people , show them how to greet them , and how to make a firm handshake with eye contact .\nFirst impressions matter .\n10 .\nTo be polite to servers .\nWhen someone is waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEmphasize to your child why they should treat servers with respect , even if they are unhappy .\nIf they act rudely

most beautiful , intelligent , and wonderful people believing they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love we believe we deserve , if you don \u2019 t see yourself as the wonderful being that you are-it \u2019 s much easier to accept bad behavior .\nSome people grow up in toxic families and are so accustomed to tragedy and chaos , that when something normal and peaceful comes along , it makes them uneasy

.\nOnce upon a time , I bounced from a long-term relationship to a long-term relationship until I realized that I was settling for people who were not good for me to avoid being alone .\nThen , I

parents are abusive , you may not entirely realize it .\nThe toxic behaviors you grew up around are normal to you .\nGoing a step further , toxic behaviors are not always obvious .\nToxicity varies from person to person .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic , another person may be more covert .\nMost toxic people know how to mask themselves enough to appear ( mostly ) normal to the outside world

onto their kids .\nDue to this , it \u2019 s very common for kids who grow up with toxic parents to constantly apologize .\n2 .\nYou find it difficult to make decisions .\nIf you struggle to make decisions , it could be because you grew up with a toxic parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutiny and are told how everything you do is wrong , it can make it very hard to trust in yourself .\n3 .\nYou take

child \u2019 s emotions ( \u2018 you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you \u2019 re scared \u2019 ) , the child doesn \u2019 t have the opportunity to develop appropriate skills to manage them , \u201d says Aude

enough .\nFirst and foremost , let \u2019 s define what gaslighting is , and go ahead and get that out of the way .\nGaslighting is the act of purposefully making someone else doubt their own version of reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own sanity .\nThe intended overall outcome is to manipulate the other person or to make them look incompetent .\nThis behavior is abuse , plain and simple .\nIf you are a parent who believes your adult child is gaslighting you and emotionally abusing you , it can be a very painful truth to face .\nNot only that , but it can be immensely difficult to communicate with someone who resorts to gaslighting .\nIf your child is gaslighting you , and you believe it is likely because of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be time to apologize .\nEven if that is the case

.\nA gaslighting child is going to try to distort reality if they do not want to push a narrative that is backed by a truth that doesn \u2019 t align with their own agenda .\nThey are likely to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or doubt yourself so that the truth goes unaccepted .\nWhile there are cases in which parents might be partially to blame for their kid \u2019 s struggles , shifting blame can also be a manipulation tactic .\nAdult kids will use this , knowing that their parents are wired to accept at least some blame .\nAt the end of the day , if there is a responsibility to be taken-own it .\nHowever , do not let that be a free card for your adult child to use any time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You make me treat you this way .\nThis one is another blame shift that is simply inexcusable .\nBasically , this is your child \u2019 s way of saying , \u201c I know what I am doing is abusive .\nBut , I am going to rationalize my toxic behavior by blaming you.\n\u201d Do not allow this-set firm boundaries here .\n4 .\nWhy are you always making such a big deal out of nothing ?\nPeople who gaslight love to minimize the obstacles of others .\nA way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions .\nThis phrase is invalidating .\nMeet this by saying , \u201c My thoughts and feelings are valid .\nIf you disagree , that is fine , but I would appreciate a little respect.\n\u201d This is another minimizing tactic that should be dealt with the same way as the last .\n6 .\nI was just kidding !\nYou take everything so seriously .\nGaslighting people tend to say and do the most toxic things , and when they get called out , they will do anything to cover their tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say they are \u2018 joking.\n\u2019 And while jokes are fine and good- it \u2019 s okay to respond by saying ,

some , a major part of this can manifest as manipulation .\nNo parent wants to admit their child is manipulating them , but the sooner you nip this behavior in the bud , the sooner you put a stop to it .\nThe last thing you want to do is give in to your child \u2019 s manipulation .\nWhile it may be hard to do if you don \u2019 t realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you realize what is happening-it \u2019 s best to stop feeding into it .\nOtherwise , this behavior may continue to bloom and while a manipulative child can be taught better , a manipulative adult is another story .\nHere are 6 signs your child is manipulating you .\nWhen your child asks you for something , and you say no , yet they continue to ask , this is badgering .\nFor example , \u201c Can I go to the park ?\n\u201d might be what your child asks .\nTo which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to go run errands .\nWe can go tomorrow.\n\u201d Then , they respond , \u201c what ?\nNo .\nCan we go to the park ?\n\u201d Nip this in the bud , by saying , \u201c No .\nWe are not going .\nIf you continue to ask , we can not go tomorrow either.\n\u201d Whenever you say no , your child is quick to lay on a guilt trip .\nFor example , if you are at the store , and you want a toy .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Not today .\nI just bought you a new toy the other day.\n\u201d In turn , they might say , \u201c You barely ever get me anything !\nJohn \u2019 s parents buy him new toys all the time .\nYou are so mean !\n\u201d Do not reward guilt trips .\nAffirm what you have said before and make it clear that you are not backing down .\nA few months ago , I was spending some time with my stepdaughter .\nShe started telling me about the school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like , \u201c My teacher is always mean to me .\nShe isn \u2019 t mean to anyone else , but she always singles me out.\n\u201d Then , she would continue and bring up ways her teacher was mean , when actually what had happened was that she was misbehaving in class and the teacher got onto her .\nThis might be innocent enough when your child is ten or eleven , but the more this behavior is encouraged , the more likely you are to raise a child with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & tell you what you want to hear .\nWhen you inquire about a situation with your child , they often bend the truth to get their way .\nFor example , you may ask before leaving to go take them to their friend \u2019 s \u201c Did you make up your bed ?\nThat was all I asked of you before I take you to Kim \u2019 s. \u201d In turn , they may say , \u201c yes , mom , I did.\n\u201d And then later , when you

as well , especially when you get to play an integral role in raising an amazing human being .\nIf you are like me , and if you are trying to raise a high achiever , researchers have pointed out one crucial thing you should be doing in your early years .\nDid you know that the way in which you talk to your toddler can determine how much of a high-achiever they will become ?\nAccording to research , it is all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones .\nSpecifically , their success rate lies in the dialogue between parent and child .\nSo what IS the right way ?\nBack in the 90s , people believed that words played a role in whether or not a child would become a higher achiever .\nHowever , instead of the kind of language being the focal point of the research , they believed that children who grew up in lower socioeconomic classes were less likely to be exposed to as many words as those who grew up in the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the 30-million-word gap .\nBasically , they believed that poor kids heard 30 million fewer words by age 3 .\nNow , we know that is not what is actually going on .\nInstead , what matters is the type of language that kids are exposed to early on .\nOne particular study carried out by MIT in 2017 found that lower-earning parents had fewer conversations with their kids than higher earners .\nWhen they observed MRIs taken from kids ages 4 , 5 , and 6 while they were being read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those children who had a more interactive story time , which included back-and-forth dialogue , were more likely to have the areas for language to exhibit more activity .\nThis helped them to conclude that it \u2019 s not talking to children that encourages brain development , but instead , talking with them .\nThis is something anyone can do , regardless of class or socioeconomic status .\nIt is all in the form of dialogue you engage your child with .\nFor example , your child may ask , \u201c How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to talk to your child and not engage them , you might say , \u201c You hit the switch , and the light comes on.\n\u201d However , if you want to really get their mind going , you instead could explain the process using mechanistic language .\n\u201c When you flip the switch up , the circuit opens , which delivers electricity to the light fixture .\nWhen you flip it down , it closes the circuit , and it prevents power from going to the light and the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth , you could ask them questions to get them even more engaged .\nWhile people who are higher on the socio-economic food chain may tend to have more dialogue with their kids than those who aren \u2019 t- the more people learn about this concept , the more able , everyone will have access to the same outcomes .\nTalking with your toddler , instead

same frustration can cause parents to react from a place of anger , which is likely to do the opposite of what you are aiming for .\nThe thing is , when you are teaching your child respect , the last thing you want to do is disrespect them .\nBefore you come for me , think about the following example : You are at a local eatery and the server comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The customer looks at the plate and says , \u201c This is all wrong !\n!\nWhat is wrong with you ?\nBring me the right plate , now !\n\u201d What would you think ?\nMost people would view this woman as unhinged and disrespectful .\nHowever , if your child didn \u2019 t listen to you , it might seem normal to respond , \u201c I have told you a million times not to do that !\nSTOP IT RIGHT NOW !\n!\n\u201d The thing is- one of these statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo how do you teach respect without losing your mind ?\nWhen your child yells at you , defies you , or treats you or someone else disrespectfully , it can be infuriating .\nHowever , as soon as you lose your cool , all bets are off for fixing the behavior .\nStay calm .\nEven if you have to take a moment to calm down , take it and then come back and talk it out .\nIf you want your child to be respectful , you have to model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also with your kids .\nYou have to give respect to get it .\nIf your expectations are too high-your child will never reach them .\nFor example , if you have a two-year-old at a public event , it \u2019 s pretty unrealistic to expect them to stay quiet .\nYou can get onto them , yell at them , talk them through it , and so on , but at the end of the day-they can only do what is developmentally within their abilities .\nWhen your child is acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they want to be disrespectful .\nInstead , the likely cause is either due to the implementation of rules or because they are dealing with difficult emotions that they do not know how to process .\nYour child likely doesn \u2019 t know yet how to say , \u201c I am hungry , and that is why I am grumpy , \u201d they just know they do not feel their best .\nWhen they act out , listen and reflect on what is happening .\nIt \u2019 s likely , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out what is going on .\nBe sure to quickly correct disrespect , respectfully .\nMake sure that there are consequences you have in place for when this happens and make sure

ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe last thing your child needs to be called , or hear you calling them or anyone else is dumb .\nThere again , they are going to end up internalizing this phrase and calling themselves and others \u2018 dumb.\n\u2019 Sadly , this is yet another word that can define your child \u2019 s sense of self-worth .\nKids and people in general , lie .\nIt \u2019 s not good and I am most definitely not excusing it .\nIf you catch your child lying , it \u2019 s time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , not call them a liar .\nUnfortunately , when you call your child a liar , you are labeling them with a word that can leave a HUGE inner wound that is far worse than whatever it was your child lied about .\nThe stop is one of those phrases that leaves a lot left to be understood .\nIf you are beginning many of your statements with the word \u2018 stop \u2019 without explaining any further your child isn \u2019 t going to understand what you are telling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body , your child \u2019 s body , and food .\nYou can quite easily destroy your child \u2019 s relationship with food by going on about dieting or trying to put them on a diet .\nInstead , focus on creating healthy and balanced meals and staying active .\nIt \u2019 s so easy to accidentally slip up when your child is being overly sensitive and call them a baby .\n\u201c Why are you crying ?\nSometimes you are such a baby !\n\u201d However , this statement is SO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously invalidated are ultimately very emotionally stunted .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

Questions To Ask Yourself When Others Try To Parent Your Children", "content": "Parenting is a tough , yet rewarding job , and it most certainly helps to have a \u2018 village.\n\u2019 However , there are times when someone else steps into parent your child a little too much , so it \u2019 s easy to become offended when someone else tries to step in and parent your child .\nIf you find that when

following first .\n1 .\nWas this person \u2019 s reaction out of line ?\nWhile it \u2019 s normal to get defensive about your child and your parenting , was this person truly out of line ?\nIf this person is a member of your \u2018 parenting village \u2019 and is someone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child , and your child was acting badly and needed to be corrected , it is likely counterproductive to get defensive .\nMost especially , this is counterproductive if your child needed to be reprimanded and the reprimanding was not beyond your comfort level .\n2 .\nWas I missing something that needed attention ?\nThere will be times when your attention is being pulled in multiple directions , so it can be easy to get distracted when your child is misbehaving .\nIf another person jumps in to get onto your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself if this person was trying to help .\nGetting defensive when someone reprimands your child and defending them when they are wrong will only undermine your efforts to implement discipline .\n3 .\nDid I need to hear it ?\nIt can be hard to hear another parent tell you that you are doing something wrong .\nHowever , just because it is hard does not mean that you don \u2019 t need to hear it .\nCriticism isn \u2019 t easy to take \u2013 but it \u2019 s necessary to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just outright out of hand , that is another story .\n4 .\nIf this person was in the wrong , how should I have handled it ?\nIf you find that this person was in the wrong , you need to make sure that you handle the situation correctly .\nIt \u2019 s important to set boundaries .\nInstead of overreacting , explain gently that you would prefer they address you instead of your child , so you can address the issue yourself .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

found an error that helped them use quantum computers , but they did not find a portal to an extra time dimension .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

doing so to be bad .\nThey are doing so because consequences make them feel powerless and by shrugging it off , they are taking some of their power back .\nRather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on making consequences a tool for learning , even if they don \u2019 t care .\nYou don \u2019 t want to hurt your child , you want to help them learn new and healthier behaviors .\nWith that said , here are 6 ways to make consequences stick .\nIf you are making consequences up as you go , it isn \u2019 t likely that you will be effective .\nInstead , make a consequence list and try to think of natural consequences that make your child uncomfortable enough to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rude to their sibling , take their favorite device away until they can go 24 hours without being hurtful or rude .\nSteer clear of giving a long and drawn-out speech .\nThe thing is , they aren \u2019 t going to listen .\nInstead , implement the consequences and keep things black and white .\n3 .\nBe clear on your expectations and the consequences .\nThe simpler your consequences , the better .\nDon \u2019 t go into a big spill , instead , give them the consequence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cool off .\nRemember , it isn \u2019 t that they don \u2019 t care , they are just reacting to anger .\nTake a moment to cool off after the incident so you can have a level head and so your child will respond better .\nDo not argue .\nDo not negotiate .\nFollow through and leave it there .\n6 .\nDon \u2019 t teach them how to do time .\nWhen you are grounding your child for a set amount of time , you are
